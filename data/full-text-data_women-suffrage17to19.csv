0,53658199,IN PARLIAMENT. WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE.,Article,"South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)",18-12-1894,Article,5131,"IN PARLIAMENT. WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE. The last week of the second session of the fourteenth Parliament was opened by the House of Assembly on Monday afternoon with vain protests against excessive work. Questions were asked about the Civil Service, and the Loan Bill, and the state of the business. At quarter-past 2 the Women's Suffrage Bill came on in Committee, and hon. members accustomed to speak to appear in print ad- dressed themselves to silk and muslin in the gallery. Clause 1— Extension of franchise — was before the Chair. Mr. Grainger produced 'Hansard' to show how hon. members had veered on the question. He began with the Chairman of Committees, who did not at one time believe woman wanted, or ought to be allowed, to stepout of her sphere. The Minister of Education interested him more. Dr. Cock- burn had considered that the change should be made gradually, and later advocated that all grave constitutional changes must be referred to tbe people. Why then this great change of front by the Minister?' Mr. Wood — He has advanced several steps. Mr. Grainger — The Minister turns like a blue bottle on the end of a pin. The Commissioner of Crown Lands and the Premier, who had opposed the measure, had also gone round. Mr. Gillen was returned opposed to woman's suffrage, and only last year voted against the measure. Women, he declared, should not have a vote unless they had a seat in Parlia- ment. He could not countenance their mixing up in politics and throwing up their hats de- lighted at the success of their favourite candi- dates. In 1890(?) the Attorney-General was not certain as to how he was going to vote — (Laughter)— and believed 'that man- kind was just as able to manage politics without women as with it.' The Premier declared that a poll of the women would be against the suffrage, and that if he supported tha franchise he would favour their sitting in Parliament. The Government, including the Government Whip, had allowed their opinions to go for the second reading. So far as he ( Mr. Grainger) could hear in the tramcars and elsewhere the women talked a good deal about fashions, a great deal about babies, and much aboat servants. (Laughter.) This cry for female suffrage was simply a sign to him of the great degeneracy of the race. We were becoming effeminate, and wanted to shift the blame and responsibilities upon the women. It was the Adam and Eve game over again. Of all the intelligent women— and he knew a good many in this colony — no one had yet propounded a satisfactory financial scheme say for the consolidation of the public debt or taxation. Mr Wood — They have no power. Mr. Grainger — They had the power to talk and they did talk. At any rate this Bill should not become operative until a new Electoral Districts Bill was passed. East Torrens or Port Adelaide would have 10,000 electors if the Adult Suffrage Bill passed, and how would the small districts like Encounter Bay, Yorke's Paniusula, and Gumeracha come out? (Mr. Archibald —'Cheer up. What about Moonta?') Moonta would be abmfc the same. Mr. Grainger observed amid considerable mer- riment that the fact of registration would be opposed to the inclinations of the women. At present it was not always easy to ascertain a woman's age. Mr. W. S. Gilbert when once asked by a young woman if he could tell her age re- plied, 'I am not sure; but however old you are you don't look it.' (Laughter.) He noticed when the census came round how anxious women were to stick at thirty for twenty years at a time. (Laughter.) They could not expect the census collector to go round looking at ladies' chins in order order to ascertain the age. Mr. Grainger pictured the cruelty which would be practised of hunting up decades of rolls to ascertain when a woman first registered as twenty-one years of age. Women from the other colonies would come at a later age and be registered to the detriment of the local article. In East Adelaide, Mount Barker, Eucounter Bay, Bjrrossa, and Victoria there were 5,000 more females than males. In East Torrens there were 2,003 more woman than men, and 1,200 in Sturt. It was not advisable to bring the colony under petticoat government. Hon. members could testify to that from personal experience. (Laughter.) Though ladies were entitled to be elected in the Legislative Council, not one had been nominated. It would be competent for the Government to take a plebiscite on the question without an Act, as the Adelaide Corporation had done about the lighting of the city. Women should be entitled to vote through tne post. The municipal voting per cent was ; — Males, 36 ; women, 23. The increase of men in the colony was 1,435 annually, and of women 2,212. He looked through the position for the Bill, and if that were all the advocates had to go on he did not think much of it. The handwriting was abominable and a reflection on the State -school system. The ladies' gallery was remarkably well filled while Mr. Grainger delivered his gibes and sneers, which closed at 2.55. Miss Spence was in the front seat. Mr. Giles moved as an amendment to add to the clause —''Who have a property qualification neces- sary to entitle them to vote in the Legislative Council.' In defending the property quali- fication Mr. Calldwell mentioned that the other day he observed a German woman using a scythe mowing in the field, and so helping her husband. Such a woman deserved greater consideration than others. Mr. Butler, who opposed the amendment, thought it would have been better if Mr. Caldwell had taken the scythe from the woman and used it instead. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Caldwell— I had to catch the train at the time, or I would have done so. Mr. Butler stated that some Liberals when they lose a bit in the world become Conserva- tives. Mr. Johnson, who opposed the exten- sion of the franchise, retorted that Conserva- tives when they lost their bit of property, became Radicals. Manhood suffrage was still on its trial. Some men, indeed, were less capable of voting than were their domestic animals, Mr. Batchelor — Do you refer to the national ass ? (Laughter.) Mr. Johnson — No ; there might be a good many of that sort in this House, (Oh.) Quiet Mr. Hague could not support the amendment on account of a hustings pledge. The Bill was premature, and the majority of his constituents, particularly the German, were opposed to it. With dramatic energy and much table thumping, the Hon. J. H. Howe, who opposed the amendment, deman- ded a referendum on the question. Mr. Grain- ger moved a prior amendment to restrict the extension of the franchise to the Assembly alone. Major Castine affirmed that the referendum would postpone women's franchise until 1900. The letters in the Register had evidently disconcerted the gallant member, for he seized the opportunity of explaining why he paired. He said the Minister asked him not to pair, and he replied that as an 'old Parliamentary hand he was not to be caught by chaff.' The Minister said— 'It does not matter very much.' Dr. Cockbum, by inter- jection, denied this altogether, but the Major reiterated it and said that being left with a freehand he paired to do a kindness to Mr. Short. He advised hon. members not to make any amendments in the Bill for fear he would vote against the measure. A sceptical demon- stration greeted this statement. Mr. McPher- son rather embarrassed the Major by forcing him to admit that he was pledged to a reduc- tion in the qualification for the Legislative Council, The colony, added the Major, was on the eve of a tremendous domestic revolution. Mr. Grainger — The price of broomsticks will go up. Major Castine— The hon. member may than get his deserts. Mr. Grainger— I hope the hon. member will not get his. Major Castine — Mr. Grainger has not had practical experience of the good woman can do. Mr. Grainger— That's not true. Major Castine— I withdraw the statement. (Hear, bear.) At 4.25 Mr. McPherson took stone- wallers to task and graciously promised not to oppose the Bill. The property qualification should be reduced, if not abolished, for the Legislative Council, and next session he would seek to effect that object. Mr. Johnson expatiated on this Fabian attack on property. According to Mr. McPherson the street nymph was to be put on the same footing as the woman of property in the franchise for the Council; it was simply a means to abolish the Council. Incidentally Mr. John- son complained that unfortunately mem- bers did not get fully reported nowadays. At 4 40 Mr. Brooker tried to apply the gag, but was defeated by 22 to 17, the Ministry making up the majority. Mr. Solomon, who opposed the closure, related an anecdote with an obvious moral. A peer once told a fashion- able lady that the able debates in the Lords frequently altered his opinion, but never his vote. The Labour party wanted to increase the representation of those who paid least to taxation and wanted most spent upon them. The numerous interjections furnished Mr. Solomon with a text for sundry elaborated remarks. After a little sparring with Mr. Foster, he promised to conscientiously block the Bill. With a referendum he would vote for it. Mr. Brooker— The last straw. Mr. Batchelor— Sounds suspicious. Mr. Solomon, who retorted that nobody was honest outside a particular party, repeated various arguments against the measure. At 5.20 a vote was taken on Mr. Grainger's amendment to restrict the extension of the franchise to the Assembly, which was negatived on the following divi- sion :— AYES, 32— Messrs. Ash, Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Caldwell, Castine, Cock, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Foster, Gilbert, Giles, Gillen, Hague, E. W. Hawker, G. C. Hawker, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Jenkins, Johnson, Kingston, McDonald. O'Loughlin. Packham, Poynton, Price, Kiddock Scherk, Short, Solomon, Wood, and Cockburn (teller). Noes, 10— Messrs. Archibald, Batchelor, Blacker Coneybeer, H. E. Downer. Griffiths, Kelly, MacGillivray, McPherson, and Grainger (teller). Majority of 22 for the Ayes Mr. Giles's amendment to add the property qualification was negatived on the following division: — AYES, 6 —Messrs. Caldwell, H. F. Downer, Gilberrt, E. W. Hawker, Short, and Giles teller). Noes, 34— Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Blacker, Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Castine, Cock, Coneybeer, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Foster Gillan, Grainger, Hague, G. C. Hawker, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Howe, Jenkins, Johnson, King- ston, McDonald. MacGillivray, McPherson, O' Lough- lin, Packham, Poynton, Price, Scherk, Solomon. Wood, and Cockburn (teller). Majority of 28 for the Noes. Clause 1 having been passed as printed, clause-B 2, which 'hereby' gave women the same rights subject to the same qualification as men, was put from the chair. Mr. Giles contended that they were here legislating for tha towns as against the country. The Minister of Education said in New Zealand the proportionate vote of the women was as great in the country districts as in the towns. Mr. Grainier— This clause gives women the right to sit in Parliament. To make the clause clear Mr. Caldwell moved to substitute 'in the matter of voting' for 'hereby.' This was negatived, and the clause passed without alteration, as also did clause 3. To the fourth and last clause— ' Short title' — Mr. Grainger proposed to add — 'That the Act shall not come into operation until a day to be fixed by proclamation issued by the Governor and pub- lished in the Government Gazette, and no proclamation shall be issued until the Chief Secretary shall have certified to the Governor that, on a reference to all electors for the House of Assembly and to all adult women in the province, a majority of such persons who vote on the question have affirmatively answered suoh question — Do you wish the franchise to be extended to women?' Mr. Caldwell said as the friends of the mea- sure wanted the referendum let them have it. Mr. Batchelor and Mr. Wood were surprised at Mr. Caldwell's action. The referendum was introduced by the opponents of the mea- sure. Mr. Grainger, to meet Mr. Batchelor, amended his amendment by inserting two questions— (1). Do you wish the franchise for the Legislative Council to be extended to women? (2). Dd you wish the franchise of the House of Assembly to be extended to women? Mr. McPherson would grant a referendum to say whether the Act when passed should not come into operation. Mr. Hamburg twitted Ministers with chang- ing front. Mr. Butler, as last year, would vote against the third reading if the referen- dum were included, because he would not give an opportunity of enlarging the constituency of one House and not tbe other. The Minis- ter, hoping to end the discussion, eloquently told hon. members that the only way to secure the reform was to stick together and vote for the Bill. Mr. Solomon— This is too rich. Dr. Cockburn proceeded that the referendum would wreck the Bill, but Mr. Solomon re- marked that the numbers were secured. The position, according to the Ministers, changed every year. Now they had the experience of New Zealand to guide them. With a voice broken with emotion he made a pathetic appeal to Mr. Caldwell (who promptly left the Chamber) not to support a clause which the previous year compelled him to vote against the measure. He gave the supporters of the measure a rallying cry in ' The Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill.' The Hon. J. H. Howe wanted the Minister to nail his oolonrs to some mast. Tha House went to tea. At night Mr. Price was convinced that the enemy was at work, but he was not going to be caught. (Hear, hear.) A division was taken on Mr. Grainger 'a amendment at seven minutes to 8, and resulted as follows : — AYES. 18— Messrs. Batchelor, Blacker, Caldwell, Sir Jenkin Coles, Messrs. H. E. Downer, Gilbert, Griffiths, Homburg, Howe, Johnson, Kelly, Land- sear, McLachlan, Moule. Riddoch, Short, Solo- mon, and Grainger (teller). NOES, 29— Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Castine, Cock, Coneybeer, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Foster, Giles, Gilles, Hague, E. W. Hawker, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Jen- kins, Kingston, Lake, McDonald, MacGillivray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Price, Scherk, Wood, and Cockburn (teller). The Chairman— A majority of 11 for the Noes. (Cheers.) Mr. Grainger— I don't think you ought to cheer, Mac. Mr. Hague moved to insert a new clause in three sub-sections to enable women to vote by post. A number of women would not dare to face the ordeal of the voting-booth. The Minister, in opposition to the amendment, said the Bill was to put women on an equality with men, and the new proposition would restore open voting among women. The Hon. J. H. Howe said it would be improper and unmanly for them to negative the amendment. Mr. McDonald supported and Mr. Poynton opposed it. Mr. Homburg said if any Government had sought to mislead the House it was this Government. Had the Absent Voters Bill interfered with the ballot? Mr. Price said the Labour party wanted no additional strength in the towns. If the dis- tances to the booths were greater in the country than in the towns, vehicles abounded in the country. Having some crossfiring with Mr. Solomon he told him that as soon as the constituencies woke up be would get his walk- ing ticket, and the talkative man from the Territory replied that he would go and contest Sturt. In the city the working women would not be allowed time to register their votes. At 8 o'clock Sir John Downer said Mr. Price could have spoken with equal force on the other side if necessary. He moved to amend the amendment by inserting ""whether she has reason to believe she will be absent from the district or not.'' Mr. Solomon made a point that the Government had actually allowed the Electoral Bill, which contained a provision for absent voting at a distance of fifteen miles, dropoff the Notice-paper in the Council. Mr. Grainger— Women would be bound to let out how they vote in any case ; they could not keep a secret. Mr. Solomon pointed out that the Labour party in the Legislative Counoil supported voting by post. The Premier, who was growing restless, stood up to smite Mr. Solomon, who was, he said, so near the Treasury benches, and yet so far from them. Mr. Solomon— Thank God, so long as you are there. The Premier was reminded of the story of Dives and Lazarus. There was a great gulf fixed between them. Mr. Grainger (rising)— Oh, carry Kingston some water. (Laughter.) The Premier observed that matters defining how persons should vote were very properly dealt with in Electoral Acts. The Electoral Bill became lapsed business because of the Council strike. The question was whether under the Absent Voters Act they had not gone too far. Mr. Biddoch— Why did you introduce it? He had done so because of the balance of con- venience. Mr. Grainger — That is what the Judges say when they give a bad judgment. The Premier—They would say a different thing to him some day. (Laughter.) It would lead to women being daily harassed by touts, and the canvassers might go off with the women's votes in their pockets. There were difficulties in the way of women while physically capable in voting, but the Govern- ment was dealing with the matter in the proper Bill. Mr. Jiiddoch strongly sup- ported the amendment Mr. Burgoyue did not worship the fetish of the secrecy of the ballot. Mr. Batchelor would not extend the Absent Voters Bill in the manner suggested. The figures showed that the proportion of voters was creator in the country than in the city. Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Landseer threw some philosophical observations into the discussion. Shortly after half-past 9 the suffrage meeting being concluded, the women trooped down to the House in such numbers that the accommodation was quite insufficient to meet the demand, and several had to stand. The affable Minster was all anxiety that the party he is doing so much for should not be incon- venienced, and earnestly consulted the Speaker as to whether further room could not be found for them. Did he want them accom- modated on the floor of the House? At any rate, Mr. Johnson remarked that there was plenty of room for them on the Treasury Bench. Soon their own gallery was crowded, and they bagan to turn the gentlemen out of the Speaker' gallery, just as they turn their protectors out of tramcars. Was their action significant of what the Bill would bring? Mr. Brooker endeavoured to rise to the occasion of the distinguished audience. Falling foul of Major Castine, he described him as a feather-bed soldier. Mr. Blacker— He is cast iron. The representative from Hind- marsh said the remark made it Blacker. Yet Mr. Brookor went on unbashed. Mr. Hague got up at ten minutes to 10 to say that in one place a polling-booth was at the back of a wine bar, the only entrance being through it. The Electoral Bill was not likely to be carried this year, and a bird in hand was worth two in the bush. Mr. Moule gave the Chair- man of Committees a rest as Major Castine hammered the desk, and promised to vote for the third reading, even if the amendment was not carried. Mr. Price rose to address the ladies' gallery, and to tell 'some one else besides everybody' that he was anxious to keep women pure. He might be suspicious, because he knew the tricks which had been carried on since he had been in the House. Mr. Solomon — You ought to know ; you are in most of them. Waxing warm, and alluding to Mr. Riddoch Mr. Price told him that the way he had advocated the Pastoral Bill was a disgrace and no game had equalled that of the Pastoral Bill. The Acting Chairman called the hon. member to the clause. Mr. Price had showed his ignorance of the Absent Voters Bill by say- ing that brutal husbauds would force wives to vote as directed, and employers dictate to female employes for whom to vote. The Treasurer, with what Mr. Price termed a merry twinkle, signalled the speaker down, and when Mr. Hague told bim that the papers had to be signed before a postmaster or a J.P. alone he collapsed. Mr. Johnson ??? the slain. Mr. Caldwell arose on a matter of privilege, and complained of what Mr. Price had said about Mr. Riddoch. Mr. Brooker— Let him defend himself. Mr. Johnson— No one pays much attention to him. Mr. Caldwell con- tended that a man could not very well defend himself. Tbe Acting Chairman said if Mr. Kiddoch had objected to the words he would have asked the hon. member to withdraw the remarks. At 10.20 Mr. Butler tried to apply the closure, but garrulity prevailed. Mr. Solomon reslew the slain. The Chief Secretary and the Hon. W. Russell were in the members' gallery. Mr. Short having supported the amendment, Mr. Coneybeer at 10.35 made a vain effort to put on the gag. Mr. Blacker coincided with Mr. Short. The Hon. J. H. Howe had a quarrel with the Labour corner. The aoomattua by the Labour party that the supporters of the amendment were wrecking tbe Bill was a deliberate - — . Parliamentary rules pre- vented from filling up the blank. Mr. Howe desired to mend Mi. Archibald's intelligence, for he could only see with one eye and that was partially decayed. (Laughter.) The Labour party were so dense that they could not see the distinction between a man end a woman. Why should women incapacitated be dis- franchised? Mr. Kiddoch referred to the unjustifiable remarks of Mr. Price. He was not in any way personally interested in pas- toral leases or interested in getting any vote on the same. He gave a vote from a dis- interested point of view, and desired to further the best interests of the country. Mr. Price could scarcely have known what he was say- ing, though he did him a great injustice. He also did an injustice by insinuating that he (Mr. Riddoch) was acting unfairly on this Bill. At 10.55 Mr. Cooeybear applied the gag, when Sir John Dowber's amendment was carried and the first section of the amend- ment by 23 to 20. The announcement of the Government defeat was received with loud cheers. The following is the division-list'.— AYES. 23-Messrs. Blacker, Butler, Caldwell, Castine, Sir Jenkin Coles, Sir John Downer, Messrs Giles, Grainger, Griffiths, E. W. Hawker, Homburg, Howe, Johnson, Kelly, Lake, Landseer, McDonald, McLachlan, Moule, Riddoch, Short, Solomon, and Hague (teller). NOES, 20-Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Brooker, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Gillen, Molder, Hooper, Hourigan, Jenkins, Kingston. MacGilIiv- ray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynston, Price, Wood, and Cockburn (teller). Majority of 3 for the Ayes. PAIRS. - Ayes— Messrs. H. E. Downer and Gilbert. Noes— Messrs. Scherk and Burgoyne, The Minister of Education moved a further amendment to Mr. Hague's amendment to neutralize the last decision by making a woman declare that she resides more than three miles from the nearest polIing-place, or that by reason of her health she will probably be unable to attend the polling-place. A dispute then arose on a point of order, Mr. Solomon contending that the closure pre- vented any further amendment. After a heated argument the Chairman ruled that the closure took place on Sir John Downer's amendment, and not Mr. Hague's amend- ment, and that that amendment could be further amended. Mr. Grainger wanted to know what was the peculiar taootity about three miles. How could a woman tell what the state of her health would be? It was a premium on lies. It might be easier to ride five miles in a car than walk three miles. The Minister of Education's amendment was carried with much cheering on the following division:— AYES.-, 23— Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Brooker, Butler, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Gilles, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Jenkins, Kingston, Lake, McDonald, MacGillivray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Price, Wood, and Cockburn (teller). Noes, 20— Mssrs. Blacker, Caldwell, Castine, Sir Jenkin Coles, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Giles, Grainger, Griffiths, E. W. Hawker, Homburg, Howe, Johnson, Kelly, Landseer, McLaughlan, Moule, Riddoch, Short, Solomon, and Hague (teller). Majority of 3 for the Ayes. PAIRS - Ayes— Messrs. Scherk and Burgoyne. Noes-Messrs. H. E. Downer and Gilbert. Major Castine was anxious to be informed if the Legislative Council would agree to such tomfoolery as this. Mr. Solomon remarked that it, was ' Kingston's magnetism.' The section as amended and section No. 3 were inserted. Mr. McDonald then moved to insert 'unless otherwise provided by Act no woman should be capable of being elected to Parlia- ment as a member of either House thereof.' The Government introduced the clause in the Bill introduced to the Council. The Minister said whether the clause was in or not the result made no difference. Women would not aspire to a seat in Parliament. He hoped the clause would not be inserted. In reply to Sir John Downer the Premier said as the Bill stood women would be entitled to sit in Parliament, Mr. Caldwell did not hanker after continuous female companionship and supported the amendment. The amendment was negatived by 28 to 8, the minority being Sir John Downer, Messrs. Butler, Caldwell, McDonald, Giles, Hague, Lake, and Landseer. Urgency was granted, and on the motion fcr the third reading Sir John Downer, at 11. 40, said the measure was different to tbe one intro- duced. Mr. Archibald— We did not vote to kill the ballot. Sir John-The Absent Voters Bill was introduced to give votes to Port Adelaide sailors whom the party could not keep together. Mr. Archibald— And four party tinkered it until it was ruined. Sir John — When the referendum was put in he did not think the Labour party after their efforts to keep women out of this and that degrading em- ployment wanted to give women the vote. He thought the Labour party wanted the referendum. The Government did not want to pass the Bill. (The Premier— 'Don't we.') Sir John— Then they were worse than he thought, for they were false to their indepen- dent opinions. He promised to vote against the measure, but Mr. Caldwell said he would support it, but if he followed his own convic- tions and the opinion of his constituents he would vote against it. He hoped the Legislative Council would minimise the evil of Mr. Hague's amendment. Major Castine in the hope that the Legisla- tive Council would take the sting out of the amendment would support the third reading. Mr. Landseer said the Government had been stringing them on. Some members would get a henpecking when they went home. Mr. Solomon arose at midnight to utter his final protest against the measure, the passage of which he regretted because of the credit of South Australia, and because it would put federation back twenty years. He sat down at thirteen minutes past mid- night, when there were eight ladies and four times that number of men in the galleries. Mr. Grainger took up Mr. SoIomon's harp. Victoria and New South Wales were not such idiots as to go for women's suffrage; so they would not federate with South Aus- tralia. He pictured the Salvationists parading West Adelaide and singing songs about 'Our Charlie.' The inconsistency of the Premier would recommend him to the ladies. Messrs. Caldwell, Howe, and McDonald having left, the third reading could not be carried. Both members for West Torrens rose together to move the ad- journment of the debate, which was carried, till to-day. The public then left tbe galleries, with a solitary exception, above the clock. At 12.20 Mr. Grainger continued the debate on the second reading of the Railway Commis- sioners Bill, and demanded to know who was to be the Commissioner. It had been bruited about the city that Mr. Hill was to be ap- pointed at £1,200 a year. What were to be the powers of the Advisory Board? Whew was the Commissioner of Pabtie World' If he did not appear, be ebould a#Ji for leave to continue bis romaiis Twe Ministers formed a search party, aud went out to find 'the Ion aeedle.' Tbe Premier, who offered toaanwerquantiofifi said the new Commissioner bad SOt bant selected. Mr. Graingtnr added the* the Premier had no right to carry bia TJadietire neis as he did agiinit a brother lawyer, aad it vt.-.b unworthy for a Government to SbMd itself behind indecision. Was the Railway CommJHBioner to have ?upremepowar! Tat Commissioner of Public Workt, who had been found and was now rccnpjriag his eeat, replied in the affirmative. Mr. Batuhelor — Did we know tbe three Bail way Commissioners when tbe Act for their appointment was passed? Mr, GrtisfaT— Xo, or the Act would not bave been patted. One Railway Commissioner at £1,200 a y«W liablo to summary dismissal would be under political control. Could we BOt go on na before instead of baring a dummy? If the Commissioner were sot a mere puppet, he would displease tbe House Roin× a&d be rot rid of. Tba Continued on Page
6 Scroll to previous page Railway Commissioners were nice fellows, but there was not one who would like to be a crea- aorea ture of the Ministry and tool of the Parlia ment. The salary was to be paid to a man to take the blame of the bungles and blunders of the Ministry. At twenty minutes to 1 Mr. Batcholor, though voting for the Bill, was nob apacially prejudiced iu favour of the control of che railways by Commissioners. He had leave to continue his remarks that day. At 12.50 the Council's amendments to the Lako Bonney Bill, with Mr. Solomon in the chair,_ were accepted, Mr. Batchelor raising an objection to No. 1 on the ground that 10 acres was as much as any settler could occupy with his labour. Mr. Brooker and Mr. Butler supported the amendment. The resolution was reported. Tho House at 12.59 adjourned till 10.30 that morning. Mr. Moule moved in vain to make the hour of meeting 2 p.m. Tho order of business to-day is :— Women's Suffrage, Loan, Railway Commissioners, Lund, and Rural Industries Bills. The Committee appointed by both Houses as to extra accommodation for the Council will meet at 11 o'clock this morning to come to a final decision."
1,202828144,IN PARLIAMENT WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE.,Article,"Evening Journal (Adelaide, SA : 1869 - 1912)",18-12-1894,Article,5024,"IN PARLIAMENT WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE. The last week of the second session of the fourteenth Parliament was opened by the House of Assembly on Monday afternoon with vain protests against excessive work. Questions were asked about the Civil Service, and the Loan Bill, and the state of the business. At quarter-past 2 the Women's Suffrage Bill same on in Committee, and hon. members accustomed to speak to appear in print addressed themselves so silk and muslin in the gallery. Clause 1—Extension of franchise —was before the Chair. Mr. Grainger produced ""Hansard"" to show how hon. members had veered on the question. He began with the Chairman of Committees, who did not at one time believe women wanted, or ought to be allowed, to step out of her sphere. The Minister of Education interested him more. Dr. Cock- burn had considered that the change should be made gradually, and later advocated that all grave constitutional changes must be referred to the people. Why then this great change of front by the Minister ? Mr. Wood —He has advanced several steps. Mr. Grainger—The Minister turns like a blue- bottle on the end of a pin. The Commissioner of Crown Lands and the Premier, who had opposed the measure, had also gone round. Mr. Gillen was returned opposed to women's suffrage, and only last year voted against the measure. Women, he declared, should not have a vote unless they had a seat in Parlia- ment. He could not countenance their mixing up in politics and throwing up their hats de- lighted at the success of their favourite candidates. In 1890 the Attorney-General was not certain as to how he was going to vote —(Laughter) — and believed ""that man- kind was just as able to manage politics without women as with it."" The Premier declared that a poll of the women would be against the suffrage, and that if he supported the franchise he would favour their sitting in Parliament. The Government, including the Government Whip, had swallowed their opinions to go for the second reading. So far as he (Mr. Grainger) could hear in the tramcars and elsewhere the women talked a good deal about fashions, a great deal about babies, and much about servants. (Laughter.) This cry for female suffrage was simply a sign to him of the great degeneracy of the race. We were becoming effeminate, and wanted to shift the blame and responsibilities upon the women. It was the Adam and Eve game over again. Of all the intelligent women— and he knew a good many in this colony— no one had yet propounded a satisfactory financial scheme say for the consolidation of the public debt or taxation. Mr. Wood — They have no power. Mr. Grainger — They had the power to talk and they did talk. At any rate this Bill should not become operative until new Electoral Districts Bill was passed. East Torrens or Port Adelaide would have 10,000 electors if the Adult Suffrage Bill passed, and how would the small districts like Encounter Bay, Yorke's Peninsula, and Gumeracha come out? (Mr. Archibald —""Cheer up. What about Moonta?"") Moonta would be about the same. Mr. Grainger observed amid considerable merriment that the fact of registration would be opposed to the inclinations of the women. At present it was not always easy to ascertain a woman's age. Mr. W. S. Gilbert when once asked by a young woman if he could tell her age re- plied, ""I am not sure; but however old you are you don't look it."" (Laughter.) He noticed when the census came round how anxious women were to stick at thirty for twenty years at a time. (Laughter.) They could not expect the census collector to go round looking at ladies' chins in order order to ascertain the age. Mr. Grainger pictured the cruelty which would be practised of hunting up decades of rolls to ascertain when a woman first registered as twenty-one years of age. Women from the other colonies would come at a later age and be registered to the detriment of the local article. In East Adelaide, Mount Barker, Encounter Bay, Barrossa, and Victoria there were 5,000 more females than males. In East Torrens there were 2,000 more women than men, and 1,200 in Sturt. It was not advisable to bring the colony under petticoat government. Hon. members could testify to that from personal experience. (Laughter.) Though ladies were entitled to be elected in the Legislative Council, not one had been nominated. It would be competent for the Government to take a plebiscite on the question without an Act, as the Adelaide Corporation had done about the lighting of the city. Women should be entitled to vote through the post. The municipal voting per cent. was:—Males, 36; women, 26. The increase of men in the colony was 1,485 annually, and of women 2,242. He looked through the petition for the Bill, and if that were all the advocates had to go on he did sot think much of it. The handwriting was abominable and a reflection on the State school system. The ladies' gallery was remarkably well filled while Mr. Grainger delivered his gibes and sneers, which closed at 2.55. Miss Spence was in the front seat. Mr. Giles moved as an amendment to add to the clause —""Who have a property qualification necessary to entitle them to vote in the Legislative Council."" In defending the property qualification Mr. Caldwell mentioned that the other day he observed a German woman using a scythe mowing in the field, and so helping her husband. Such a woman deserved greater consideration than others. Mr. Butler, who opposed the amendment, thought it would have been better if Mr. Caldwell had taken the scythe from the woman and used it instead. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Caldwell—I had to catch the train at the time, or I would have done so. Mr. Butler stated that some Liberals when they rose a bit in the world became Conservatives. Mr. Johnson, who opposed the extension of the franchise, retorted that Conservatives when they lost their bit of property, became Radicals. Manhood suffrage was still on its trial. Some men, indeed, were less capable of voting than were their domestic animals. Mr. Batchelor — Do you refer to the national ass? (Laughter.) Mr. Johnson—No; there might be a good many of that sort in this House. (Oh.) Quiet. Mr. Hague could not support the amendment on account of a hustings pledge. The Bill was premature, and the majority of his constituents, particularly the German, were opposed to it. With dramatic energy and much table thumping, the Hon. J. H. Howe, who opposed the amendment, demanded a referendum on the question. Mr. Grainger moved a prior amendment to restrict the extension of the franchise to the Assembly alone. Major Castine affirmed that the referendum would postpone women's franchise until 1900. The letters in the Register had evidently disconcerted the gallant member, for he seized the opportunity of explaining why he paired. He said the Minister asked him not to pair, and he replied that as an ""old Parliamentary hand he was not to be caught by chaff."" The Minister said—""It does not matter very much."" Dr. Cockburn, by interjection, denied this altogether, but the Major reiterated it and said that being left with a free hand he paired to do a kindness to Mr. Short. He advised hon. members not to make any amendments in the Bill for fear he would vote against the measure. A sceptical demonstration greeted this statement. Mr. McPher- son rather embarrassed the Major by forcing him to admit that he was pledged to a reduction in the qualification for the Legislative Council. The colony, added the Major, was on the eve of a tremendous domestic revolution. Mr. Grainger—The price of broomsticks will go up. Major Castine—The hon. member may then get his deserts. Mr. Grainger—I hope the hon. member will not get his. Major Castine—Mr. Grainger has not had practical experience of the good woman can do. Mr. Grainger—That's not true. Major Castine—I withdraw the statement. (Hear, hear.) At 4.25 Mr. McPherson took stone-wallers to task and graciously promised not to oppose the Bill. The property qualification should be reduced, if not abolished, for the Legislative Council, and next session he would seek to effect that object. Mr. Johnson expatiated on this Fabian attack on property. According to Mr. McPherson the street nymph was to be put on the same footing as the woman of property in the franchise for the Council: it was simply a means to abolish the Council. Incidentally Mr. John- son complained that unfortunately members did not get fully reported nowadays. At 4 40 Mr. Brooker tried to apply the gag, but was defeated by 22 to 17, the Ministry making up the majority. Mr. Solomon, who opposed the closure, related an anecdote with an obvious moral. A peer once told a fashionable lady that the able debates in the Lords frequently altered his opinion, but never his vote. The Labour party wanted to increase the representation of those who paid least to taxation and wanted most spent upon them. The numerous interjections furnished Mr. Solomon with a text for sundry elaborated remarks. After a little sparring with Mr. Foster, he promised to conscientiously block the Bill. With a referendum he would vote for it. Mr. Brooker—The last straw. Mr. Batchelor—Sounds suspicious. Mr. Solomon, who retorted that nobody was honest outside a particular party, repeated various arguments against the measure. At 5.20 a vote was taken on Mr. Grainger's amendment to restrict the extension of the franchise to the Assembly, which was negatived on the following division:— AYES, 32—Messrs. Ash, Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Caldwell, Castine, Cock, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Foster, Gilbert, Giles, Gillen, Hague, E. W. Hawker, G. C. Hawker, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Jenkins, Johnson, Kingston, McDonald, O'Loughlin, Packham, Poynton, Price, Riddoch, Scherk, Short, Solomon, Wood, and Cockburn (teller). NOES, 10—Messrs. Archibald, Batchelor, Blacker, Coneybeer, H. E. Downer, Griffiths, Kelly, MacGillivray, McPherson, and Grainger (teller). Majority of 22 for the Ayes. Mr. Giles's amendment to add the property qualification was negatived on the following division:— AYES, 6—Messrs. Caldwell, H. E. Downer, Gilbert, E. W. Hawker, Short, and Giles (teller). NOES, 34—Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Blacker, Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Castine, Cock, Coneybeer, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Foster, Gillen, Grainger, Hague, G. C. Hawker, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Howe, Jenkins, Johnson, Kingston, McDonald, MacGillivray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Packham, Poynton, Price, Scherk, Solomon, Wood, and Cockburn (teller). Majority of 28 for the Noes. Clause 1 having been passed as printed, clause 2, which "" hereby"" gave women the same rights subject to the same qualification as men, was put from the chair. Mr. Giles contended that they were here legislating for the towns as against the country. The Minister of Education said in New Zealand the proportionate vote of the women was as great in the country districts as in the towns. Mr. Grainger—This clause gives women the right to sit in Parliament. To make the clause clear Mr. Caldwell moved to substitute ""in the matter of voting"" for ""hereby."" This was negatived, and the clause passed without alteration, as also did clause 3. To the fourth and last clause—"" Short title""—Mr. Grainger proposed to add—""That the Act shall not come into operation until a day to be fixed by proclamation issued by the Governor and published in the Government Gazette, and no proclamation shall be issued until the Chief Secretary shall have certified to the Governor that, on a reference to all electors for the House of Assembly and to all adult women in the province, a majority of such persons who vote on the question have affirmatively answered such question — Do you wish the franchise to be extended to women?"" Mr. Caldwell said as the friends of the measure wanted the referendum let them have it. Mr. Batchelor and Mr. Wood were surprised at Mr. Caldwell's action. The referendum was introduced by the opponents of the measure. Mr. Grainger, to meet Mr. Batchelor, amended his amendment by inserting two questions—(1). Do you wish the franchise for the Legislative Council to be extended to women? (2). Do you wish the franchise of the House of Assembly to be extended to women? Mr. McPherson would grant a referendum to say whether the Act when passed should not come into operation. Mr. Homburg twisted Ministers with changing front. Mr. Butler, as last year, would vote against the third reading if the referendum were included, because he would not give an opportunity of enlarging the constituency of one House and not the other. The Minister, hoping to end the discussion, eloquently told hon. members that the only way to secure the reform was to stick together and vote for the Bill. Mr. Solomon—This is too rich. Dr. Cockburn proceeded that the referendum would wreck the Bill, but Mr. Solomon remarked that the numbers were secured. The position, according to the Ministers, changed every year. Now they had the experience of New Zealand to guide them. With a voice broken with emotion he made a pathetic appeal to Mr. Caldwell (who promptly left the Chamber) not to support a clause which the previous year compelled him to vote against the measure. He gave the supporters of the measure a rallying cry in "" The Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill."" The Hon. J. H. Howe wanted the Minister to nail his colours to some mast. The House went to tea. At night Mr. Price was convinced that the enemy was at work, but he was not going to be caught. (Hear, hear.) A division was taken on Mr. Grainger's amendment at seven minutes to 8, and resulted as follows :— AYES, 18—Messrs. Batchelor, Blacker, Caldwell, Sir Jenkin Coles, Messrs. H. E. Downer, Gilbert, Griffiths, Homburg, Howe, Johnson, Kelly, Landseer, McLachlan, Moule, Riddoch, Short, Solomon, and Grainger (teller). NOES, 29—Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Castine, Cock, Coneybeer, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Foster, Giles, Gillen, Hague, E. W. Hawker, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Jenkins, Kingston, Lake, McDonald, MacGillivray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Price, Scherk, Wood, and Cockburn (teller). The Chairman—A majority of 11 for the Noes. (Cheers.) Mr. Grainger—I don't think you ought to cheer, Mac. Mr. Hague moved to insert a new clause in three sub-sections to enable women to vote by post. A number of women would not care to face the ordeal of the voting-booth. The Minister, in opposition to the amendment, said the Bill was to put women on an equality with men, and the new proposition would restore open voting among women. The Hon. J. H. Howe said it would be improper and unmanly for them to negative the amendment. Mr. McDonald supported and Mr. Poynton opposed it. Mr. Homburg said if any Government had sought to mislead the House it was this Government. Had the Absent Voters Bill interfered with the ballot ? Mr. Price said the Labour party wanted no additional strength in the towns. If the distances to the booths were greater in the country than in the towns, vehicles abounded in the country. Having some crossfiring with Mr. Solomon he told him that as soon as the constituencies woke up he would get his walking ticket, and the talkative man from the Territory replied that he would go and contest Sturt. In the city the working women would not be allowed time to register their votes. At 8 o'clock Sir John Downer said Mr. Price could have spoken with equal force on the other side if necessary. He moved to amend the amendment by inserting "" whether she has reason to believe she will be absent from the district or not."" Mr. Solomon made a point that the Government had actually allowed the Electoral Bill, which contained a provision for absent voting at a distance of fifteen miles, drop off the Notice-paper in the Council. Mr. Grainger—Women would be bound to let out how they vote in any case; they could not keep a secret. Mr. Solomon pointed out that the Labour party in the Legislative Council supported voting by post. The Premier, who was growing restless, stood up to smite Mr. Solomon, who was, he said, so near the Treasury benches, and yet so far from them. Mr. Solomon—Thank God, so long as you are there. The Premier was reminded of the story of Dives and Lazarus. There was a great gulf fixed between them. Mr. Grainger (rising)—Oh, carry Kingston some water. (Laughter.) The Premier observed that matters defining how persons should vote were very properly dealt with in Electoral Acts. The Electoral Bill became lapsed business because of the Council strike. The question was whether under the Absent Voters Act they had not gone too far. Mr. Riddoch—Why did you introduce it? He had done so because of the balance of convenience. Mr. Grainger—That is what the Judges say when they give a bad judgment. The Premier—They would say a different thing to him some day. (Laughter.) It would lead to women being daily harassed by touts, and the canvassers might go off with the women's votes in their pockets. There were difficulties in the way of women while physically capable in voting, but the Government was dealing with the matter in the proper Bill. Mr. Riddoch strongly supported the amendment. Mr. Burgoyne did not worship the fetish of the secrecy of the ballot. Mr. Batchelor would not extend the Absent Voters Bill in the manner suggested. The figures showed that the proportion of voters was greater in the country than in the city. Mr. Caldwell and Mr. Landseer threw some philosophical observations into the discussion. Shortly after half-past 9 the suffrage meeting being concluded, the women trooped down to the House in such numbers that the accommodation was quite insufficient to meet the demand, and several had to stand. The affable Minister was all anxiety that the party he is doing so much for should not be inconvenienced, and earnestly consulted the Speaker as to whether further room could not be found for them. Did he want them accommodated on the floor of the House? At any rate, Mr. Johnson remarked that there was plenty of room for them on the Treasury Bench. Soon their own gallery was crowded, and they began to turn the gentlemen out of the Speaker' gallery, just as they turn their protectors out of tramcars. Was their action significant of what the Bill would bring? Mr. Brooker endeavoured to rise to the occasion of the distinguished audience. Falling foul of Major Castine, he described him as a feather-bed soldier. Mr. Blacker—He is cast iron. The representative from Hind- marsh said the remark made it Blacker. Yet Mr. Brooker went on unbashed. Mr. Hague got up at ten minutes to 10 to say that in one place a polling-booth was at the back of a wine bar, the only entrance being through it. The Electoral Bil was not likely to be carried this year, and a bird in hand was worth two the bush. Mr. Moule gave the Chairman of Committees a rest as Major Castine hammered the desk, and promised to vote for the third reading, even if the amendment was not carried. Mr. Price rose to address the ladies' gallery, and to tell ""some one else besides everybody "" that he was anxious to keep women pure. He might be suspicious, because he knew the tricks which had been carried on since he had been in the House. Mr. Solomon— You ought to know; you are in most of them. Waxing warm, and alluding to Mr. Riddoch Mr. Price told him that the way he had advocated the Pastoral Bill was a disgrace, and no game had equalled that of the Pastoral Bill. The Acting Chairman called the hon. member to the clause. Mr. Price soon showed his ignorance of the Absent Voters Bill by saying that brutal husbands would force wives to vote as directed, and employers dictate to female employés for whom to vote. The Treasurer, with what Mr. Price termed a merry twinkle, signalled the speaker down, and when Mr. Hague told him that the papers had to be signed before a postmaster or a J. P. alone he collapsed. Mr. Johnson slew the slain. Mr. Caldwell arose on a matter of privilege, and complained of what Mr. Price had said about Mr. Riddoch. Mr. Brooker—Let him defend himself. Mr. Johnson—No one pays much attention to him. Mr. Caldwell contended that a man could not very well defend himself. The Acting Chairman said if Mr. Riddoch had objected to the words he would have asked the hon. member to withdraw the remarks. At 10.20 Mr. Butler tried to apply the closure, but garrulity prevailed. Mr. Solomon reslew the slain. The Chief Secretary and the Hon. W. Russell were in the members' gallery. Mr. Short having supported the amendment, Mr. Coneybeer at 10.35 made a vain effort to put on the gag. Mr. Blacker coincided with Mr. Short. The Hon. J. H. Howe had a quarrel with the Labour corner. The accusation by the Labour party that the supporters of the amendment were wrecking the Bill was a deliberate ——. Parliamentary rules prevented from filling up the blank. Mr. Howe desired to mend Mr. Archibald's intelligence, for he could only see with one eye and that was partially decayed. (Laughter.) The Labour party were so dense that they could not see the distinction between a man and a woman. Why should women incapacitated be disfranchised? Mr. Riddoch referred to the unjustifiable remarks of Mr. Price. He was not in any way personally interested in pastoral leases or interested in getting any vote on the same. He gave a vote from a disinterested point of view, and desired to further the best interests of the country. Mr. Price could scarcely have known what he was say- ing, though he did him a great injustice. He also did an injustice by insinuating that he (Mr. Riddoch) was acting unfairly on this Bill. At 10.55 Mr. Coneybeer applied the gag, when Sir John Downer's amendment was carried and the first section of the amendment by 23 to 20. The announcement of the Government defeat was received with loud cheers. The following is the division-list:— Ayes, 23—Messrs. Blacker, Butler, Caldwell, Castine, Sir Jenkin Coles, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Giles, Grainger, Griffiths, E. W. Hawker, Homburg, Howe, Johnson, Kelly, Lake, Landseer, McDonald, McLachlan, Moule, Riddoch, Short, Solomon, and Hague (teller). NOES, 20—Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Brooker, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Gillen, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Jenkins, Kingston, MacGillivray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Price, Wood, and Cockburn (teller). Majority of 3 for the Ayes. PAIRS.—Ayes—Messrs. H. E. Downer and Gilbert. Noes—Messrs. Scherk and Burgoyne. The Minister of Education moved a further amendment to Mr. Hague's amendment to neutralize the last decision by making a woman declare that she resides more than three miles from the nearest polling-place, or that by reason of her health she will probably be unable to attend the polling-place. A dispute then arose on a point of order, Mr. Solomon contending that the closure prevented any further amendment. After a heated argument the Chairman ruled that the closure took place on Sir John Downer's amendment, and not Mr. Hague's amendment, and that that amendment could be further amended. Mr. Grainger wanted to know what was the peculiar sanctity about three miles. How could a woman tell what the state of her health would be? It was a premium on lies. It might be easier to ride five miles in a car than walk three miles. The Minister of Education's amendment was carried with much cheering on the following division:— AYES, 23—Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Brooker, Butler, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Gillen, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Jenkins, Kingston, Lake, McDonald, MacGillivray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Price, Wood, and Cockburn (teller). NOES, 20—Messrs. Blacker, Caldwell, Castine, Sir Jenkin Coles, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Giles, Grainger, Griffiths, E. W. Hawker, Homburg, Howe, Johnson, Kelly, Landseer, McLachlan, Moule, Riddoch, Short, Solomon, and Hague (teller). Majority of 3 for the Ayes. PAIRS.— Ayes—Messrs. Scherk and Burgoyne. Noes—Messrs. H. E. Downer and Gilbert. Major Castine was anxious to be informed if the Legislative Council would agree to such tomfoolery as this. Mr. Solomon remarked that it was ""Kingston's magnetism."" The section as amended and section No. 3 were inserted. Mr. McDonald then moved to insert "" unless otherwise provided by Act no woman should be capable of being elected to Parliament as a member of either House thereof."" The Government introduced the clause in the Bill introduced to the Council. The Minister said whether the clause was in or not the result made no difference. Women would not aspire to a seat in Parliament. He hoped the clause would not be inserted. In reply to Sir John Downer the Premier said as the Bill stood women would be entitled to sit in Parliament. Mr. Caldwell did not hanker after continuous female companionship and supported the amendment. The amendment was negatived by 28 to 8, the minority being Sir John Downer, Messrs. Butler, Caldwell, McDonald, Giles, Hague, Lake, and Landseer. Urgency was granted, and on the motion for the third reading Sir John Downer, at 11.40, said the measure was different to the one introduced. Mr. Archibald—We did not vote to kill the ballot. Sir John—The Absent Voters Bill was introduced to give votes to Port Adelaide sailors whom the party could not keep together. Mr. Archibald—And your party tinkered it until it was ruined. Sir John—When the referendum was put in he did not think the Labour party after their efforts to keep women out of this and that degrading employment wanted to give women the vote. He thought the Labour party wanted the referendum. The Government did not want to pass the Bill. (The Premier—""Don't we."") Sir John—Then they were worse than he thought, for they were false to their independent opinions. He promised to vote against the measure, but Mr. Caldwell said he would support it, but if he followed his own convictions and the opinion of his constituents he would vote against it. He hoped the Legislative Council would minimize the evil of Mr. Hague's amendment. Major Castine in the hope that the Legislative Council would take the sting out of the amendment would support the third reading. Mr. Landseer said the Government had been stringing them on. Some members would get a henpecking when they went home. Mr. Solomon arose at midnight to utter his final protest against the measure, the passage of which he regretted because of the credit of South Australia, and because it would put federation back twenty years. He sat down at thirteen minutes past midnight, when there were eight ladies and four times that number of men in the galleries. Mr. Grainger took up Mr. Solomon's harp. Victoria and New South Wales were not such idiots as to go for woman's suffrage; so they would not federate with South Aus- tralia. He pictured the Salvationists parading West Adelaide and singing songs about ""Our Charlie."" The inconsistency of the Premier would recommend him to the ladies. Messrs. Caldwell, Howe, and McDonald having left, the third reading could not be carried. Both members for West Torrens rose together to move the adjournment of the debate, which was carried, till to-day. The public then left the galleries, with a solitary exception, above the clock. At 12.20 Mr. Grainger continued the debate on the second reading of the Railway Commissioners Bill, and demanded to know who was to be the Commissioner. It had been bruited about the city that Mr. Hill was to be appointed at £1,200 a year. What were to be the powers of the Advisory Board? Where was the Commissioner of Public Works ? If he did not appear, he should ask for leave to continue his remarks. Two Ministers formed a search party, and went out to find ""the lost needle."" The Premier, who offered to answer questions, said the new Commissioner had not been selected. Mr. Grainger added that the Premier had no right to carry his vindictive- ness as he did against a brother lawyer, and it was unworthy for a Government to shield itself behind indecision. Was the Railway Commissioner to have supreme power ? The Commissioner of Public Works, who had been found and was now occupying his seat, replied in the affirmative. Mr. Batchelor—Did we know the three Railway Commissioners when the Act for their appointment was passed? Mr. Grainger— No, or the Act would not have been passed. One Railway Commissioner at £1,200 a year liable to summary dismissal would be under political control. Could we not go on as before instead of having a dummy? If the Commissioner were not a mere puppet, he would displease the House sometimes and be got rid of. The Railway Commissioners were nice fellows, but there was not one who would like to be a creature of the Ministry and tool of the Parliament. The salary was to be paid to a man to take the blame of the bungles and blunders of the Ministry. At twenty minutes to 1 Mr. Batchelor, though voting for the Bill, was not specially prejudiced in favour of the control of the railways by Commissioners. He had leave to continue his remarks that day. At 12.50 the Council's amendments to the Lake Bonney Bill, with Mr. Solomon in the chair, were accepted, Mr. Batchelor raising an objection to No. 1 on the ground that 10 acres was as much as any settler could occupy with his labour. Mr. Brooker and Mr. Butler supported the amendment. The resolution was reported. The House at 12.59 adjourned till 10.30 that morning. Mr. Moule moved in vain to make the hour of meeting 2 p.m. The order of business to-day is :—Women's Suffrage, Loan, Railway Commissioners, Land, and Rural Industries Bills. The Committee appointed by both Houses as to extra accommodation for the Council will meet at 11 o'clock this morning to come to a final decision."
2,53658169,FEMALE SUFFRAGE. TO THE EDITOR.,Article,"South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)",18-12-1894,Article,443,"FEMALE SUFFRAGE. TO THE EDITOR. Sir— Apart from the abundant and weighty objections which are urged against granting female suffrage at all, or at any rate until its working in other countries can be observed, it is idle to say that the subject has ever been before the present electors in any serious way adequate to its importance. It may have been spoken of in a by-the-way sort of fashion. So has repudiation and some other unpleasant contingencies, but is has never baen put for ward us a paramount question to be voted upon. The position in that, without the ex press consent of the electors who suns them into Parliament members are about to intro duce into electoral competition with them another large voting body. Is this loyal? Parliament may have the power— discresion- ary powers are sometimes conferred, but always in the belief that they will be exer- cised judisciously and above all in the interests of the app- inter. What prudent man would be guilty of such a gross abuse of tho confi- dence as to do an act which would deprive his principal of half his influence without special conference and iuatrucliuu? This is not a question of ordinary legislation which if found to be bad can be easily amended or repealed, but if the crea tion of a fresh and entirely unusual body of voters who, whether they exer- cisa their powers ill or well, are never likely to consent to be deprived of it. Such a fundamental change as this, involving such enormous and unknown possibilities, should not be made without the fullest assu- rance that the electors who have put the members into Parliament wish it made. Members do not seem to me to have ade- quately considered this aspect of the ques- tion. I am no advocate for members being mere delegates on ordinary matters, but such an important question as the admission of a new partner in the firm should surely be sub- mitted to the old partners first for a definite consent. A small nagging band of profes- sional agitators claim, though with more than doubtful credentials, to represent the pro posed new partner, and seem bent on hurrying the members by any and every means into passnug this thing for fear that reflection may injure its chances. Simple justice to the pre sent electors demands that members should reaeno such shameless haste. I am, Sir, &c, W. L. WARE. Glenelg, December 17. He was an applicant for a position as tram car conductor. ' What are your qualifications for the place?' asked the Superintendent. ? 'I used to work in a sardine packing establish- ment.'"

Sir— Major Castine's contemptuous remarks concerning Mr. C. Proud and his letter in the Register of 13th inst. are scarcely in good taste. Mr. Proud being a member of the executive of the Women's Suffrage League is in honour bound to protect its interests, and is sufficiently acquainted with Parliamentary usage to know, as do many others, that when a Constitutional measure requiring an abso- lute majority is before the House every member who pairs virtually votes against the Bill and plays into the hands of its oppo- nents. Major Castine promised his support, and we look to him to redeem that promise by voting for the third reading. Mr. Proud has the cordial gratitude of the women who ask for the franchise for his able and courteous letter. ""One Who Worked Hard to Get Mr. Hawker Elected"" says the majority of that gentleman's constituents will be much obliged if he will vote against the third reading of the Bill. As a resident in Hon. G. C. Hawker's district I venture to question that statement, and to say that a very large number of his consti- tuents desire to be represented by a consi- tent member, such as Mr. Hawker has proved himself, and although they can quite under- stand his avoidance of late sittings — which would not be needed if all members were as straightforward as himself— yet they rely upon his vote for the third reading of a Bill which he is known conscientiously to support. Whether women secure the vote or not, it is possible that in the next general elections members will discover that the country approves of men who keep their promises and vote according to their convictions, and not in the supposed interests of a party. The names of those who vote for the Adult Suf- frage Bill will be handed down as those of true statesmen, wise and farseeing. "" Light"" says 137 women heads of household in Kapunda signed a petition against the Bill. I wonder whether he thinks that his 137 townswomen should decide against the thousands of women who have signed positions in favour of the Bill in all parts of the colony. This is an ethical, not a parochial, question. I am, Sir, &c., E. W. NICHOLLS. There is nothing more tantalising to a man than to go home with something in his mind he wants to grumble about, and find company there, and be obliged to do the polite."
4,53659911,WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE. WELCOME TO MISS SPENCE.,Article,"South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)",19-12-1894,Article,798,"WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE. WELCOME TO MISS SPENCE. The large room of the Cafe de Paris was crowded on Monday evening by woman's suffragiste, chiefly ladies, to welcome back from her travels Miss C. H. Spence. Mrs. Nicholls (President of the W.C.T.U.) pre sided. The Chairman heartily welcomed Miss Spence, of whom they were proud, on account ot the splendid work she had done. (Cheers.) They rejoiced that she had such a long holiday, and had during it been able to do so much good. (Hear, hear.) She had been privileged to meet in America and on the Continent many workers in the same movements who were making an im pression upon the history of the world. They were glad to be able to tell Miss Spenoe that the Adult Suffrage bill was nearly passed. Some of them had been at the House nearly all the afternoon listening to the debate, and they were going there after the meeting to await for the ultimate decision, if they had to wait all night. (Applause.) Mrs. Mary Lee said she bad been listening to the Senators, and had arrived at the con clusion that those who had the least to say took the longest time to say it. She had time after time challenged those who opposed women's suffrage to bring forward a single argument against it, but they had not done so. Every man had a right to a free mother and wife, and they could not have that until they had the suffrage. Miss George also welcomed Miss Spence. She had won the regard of very many of their American sisters. Women had the right.to the suffrage, and they wanted it on the same terms as the men. The Rev. J. Day Thompson moved— That this meeting, assembled to welcome Miss Spence back to the colony, congratulates the Government on the passing of the second reading of the Women's Suffrage Bill, and expresses the earnest hope that every supporter of the Bill will record his vote for the third reading and not throw it away under the pretext of pairing. He joined in welcoming Miss Spence, whom he oould not but describe as the ' Grand Old Woman.' As to tbe Bill before the House, if all those present went to the House that evening they would intimidate the members to vote in favour of it. Miss Spence’s whole life and interests had been sacrificed to great questions. He welcomed her as a woman who had championed some of the greatest causes in the world, and he was sure she was more than ever ready to work. The woman in her was lost in the cause. (Cheers. ) The Rev. J. C. Kujby seconded. It was an honour to the Kingston Ministry that they had so successfully piloted the women's franchise measure to its present position. He highly appreciated Miss Spenoe's worth, and hoped that she would be spared for many years to exercise her gifts for the good of the people. Mr. C. Proud supported. Carried with applause Miss Spence who was received with hearty applause, thanked them sincerely for the welcome. She had always been in favour of women's suffrage, but in her advocacy of effective voting she had not wished to identify herself with any party. She hoped that before she was too decrepit she would be able to go to the poll and record her vote. Wherever she had been she had identified herself with the suffrage, and found that the leaders were extremely zealous and hard working. It was only right that every person should have a say in making those laws which affected all. She hoped for the time when women would have their fair place and fair share of power, and when all shades of opinion could find a hearing in the halls of Legisla ture and adequate discussion in the columns of the Press. Miss Spenca then narrated many of her experiences of travel. She desig nated the two great parties in America as parties of spoil rather than of progress. Nothing oould be done in social reform with out there first being political reform. So long as politics were corrupt, and there were money gifts and promises of office and position as a reward for political service, so long would social and moral reforms be impos sible. When women reoeived the right to vote then work would only just begin. In order to give proper effect to it they would have to learn more, think more, and weigh subjects more than they had in the past. She was very glad to get back to her home and to her work in Australia. The meeting then broke up, many of the ladies walking direct to Parliament House."

There was a large attendance, comprised chiefly of ladies, at the Cafe de Paris on Mon- day evening when those in favor of women's suffrage gave a hearty welcome to Miss Spence. Mrs. Nicholls, the Australasian president of the Women's Christian Temperance Union. occupied the chair. Mrs. Nicholls wished to say a word or two in favor of women's suffrage, and also to wel- come Miss Spence, of whom they were all so proud. She spoke in the very highest terms of praise of Miss Spence and the work she had done. They rejoiced that she had had such a long holiday and had been able to do so much good while away. She had had the pleasure of meeting many workers in America and on the Continent who were making an impression on the history of the world. The Franchise Bill was now almost through the House of Assembly, and it would not be long, she thought, before it was passed. Some of them had been at Parliament House all the after- noon and they were going to return when the meeting was concluded. They would wait there until it was decided upon if they had to listen all night. The meeting that night was comprised of those who were in favor of women's suffrage. Although theymight not be at one on all subjects they were on that one and also in the welcome to Miss Spence. Mrs. Mary Lee had not such to say, as on the platform and in the press she had ex- hausted all her arguments. She had listened to the senators talking on the subject, and had come to to the conclusion that those who had the least to say took the longest to say it it. She had time after time challenged those who were opposed to the suffrage being granted to women to bring forward a single argument against it, and they had not done so. Every man had a right to a free mother and wife, and they could not have this until the latter had the suffrage. Miss George, as a South Australian, had much pleasure in giving Miss Spence a hearty welcome back. She had won the regard of very many of their American sisters. She strongly urged the right that women had to the suffrage, and said they wanted their vote on the same terms as the men had it granted to them. The Rev. J. DAY THOMPSON moved— That this meeting assembled to welcome Miss Spence back to the colony congratulates the Govern- ment on the passing of the second reading of the Women's Suffrage Bill, and expresses the earnest hope that every supporter of the Bill will record his vote for the third reading and not throw it away under the pretext of pairing. He followed Miss George in welcoming Miss Spence, whom he could not but describe as the ""Grand Old Woman."" As to the Bill now before the House, he thought that if all those present went to the House that evening they would intimidate the members to vote in favor of it. (Laughter.) Miss Spence's whole life and interests had been sacrificed to great questions. He welcomed her as a woman who was a champion of some of the greatest causes in the world, and he was sure that she was now more than ever ready to take that position. The woman in her was lost in the cause. The Rev. J. C. KlRBY seconded the motion, and said it wan an honor to the Kingston Ministry that they had so successfully piloted the women's franchise measure to its present position. He expressed the highest apprecia- tion of Miss Spence's worth, and the desire that she would be spared for many years to exercise her gifts for the good of the people. The motion was supported by Mr. C. PROUD and carried. Miss SPENCE, who was greeted with applause, after thanking them for their wel- come, said she had always been in favor of women's suffrage, but in her advocacy of effective voting had not wished to identify herself with any party.

Major Caatine a-jknowL-dged that tha nr.j;x«ed provision njipeided to his fecl iiip-s uj a man, a husband, and a lather.

When the record published on Saturday in The Advertiser ceased the Assembly was still debating the item in the resolution, on which the Loan Bill is to be founded, which autho- rises the expenditure of an additional sum of £124,220 on the purchase of locomotive engines from Messrs. James Martin & Co. After an ineffectual attempt by Mr- * Brooker to clap on the closure the line passed, and in the next ten minutes these amounts went through—Water {supplies, £25,000 ; strengthen ing bridges, £10,000; protection torn flood damages, £10,000; and additional requirements for traffic and locomotive and ways and works accommodation, £10,000. This completed the £200,470 required for railways. The first lines under the head of waterworks caused no talk, j They were:—Adelaide water district, £10,000; country water district, £10,000. Then Happy Valley, 42ua,000, was reached. At 2 o'ducK the legislators in the House were:—Awake —rbe Sneaker, the Chair man, the Premier, the Treasurer, the Minister of Education, Messrs. Solomon, McDonald, Houngan, iondseer, iindnger, Brooker, Caatine, Moule, Wood, Bartlett, McOillivray, Poynton, and Short. Asleep— The Commissioner of Public Works, iiessra. Price, Kelly, McPherson, and Coneybuer. Two minutes after the hour named the big sum was authorised, and Beetaloo reservoir, £150,0011, came up for considera tion. This was much talked about. Major Castine, Air. Bartlett, and Air. Howe spoke earnestly on various sides of the ques tion and at 2.55 a-tn. the line passed, 'xnen very rapidly the committee accepted these amounts—ifeepening l'ort Pine, £2,500; various outports, £3,000; Fowler's Bay jetty, £1,500 ; and defence of King George's' Sound, £1,500. The Treasurer undertook that the £2,670 promised, towards the defences of Thursday Island should not be paid unless the other colonies kept their obligations in respect to Port Darwin. This satisfied Mr. Solomon and the line passed. There was a long talk as to the proposed vote of £30,000 for die construction of main roads, which Mr. Grainger described as a bribe to the consti tuencies. If members kept their hustings pledges only to support the provision of re productive works out of loans, he said, this tine would never be authorised. The fin* division of the sitting mas demanded in respect to it at 3.35 rn.nL, and die sanction |of Parliament was given to the expendi ttire by 25 votes to those of Messrs. Grainger, Solomon, and Kelly. The biggest amount in the Bill, £400,000, f or improvements on pastoral leases, was now reached, and after a protest against borrowing money which would never be paid back Sir. Grainger stumped out of the chamber. Mr. Banlett brusquely described the vote as a swindle. In reply to a question the Treasurer stated that the existing loan provision for dm payment for improvements totalled £233,000. The pre sent liability was—During this year 5128.U00, during 1895 £127,000, in U96 £153,000, and in 1897 £238,000. Mr. Brookcr moved toreduoethe amount to £200,000 and Mr. Holder agreed to this, as no principle was involved. The redac tion would merely mean that one year lea would be provided for. Mr. Poynton con sidered that all the scandalous valuations should be riwrirrd. Then the lesser sum was accepted at 43 a.m., the members then in the chamber being the Speaker, the Chairman, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Education, the Commissioner of Public Works, tike Commissioner of Crown Latidft, Messrs. Honrigui, Coneybeer, McGillivray, Foster, Batchelor, McDonald, Hooper, Solomon, Short Howe, Brooker, Castine, Moule, Wood, Poynton, OXoughlin, Kelly, and Archibald. The Adrertijer arrived just here and members brightened up in conse quence. The next vote ""Pubtic Library, Museum, and Art Gallery, £3,880,"" caused no talk, bat there was some interest shown in ""drainage south-eastern lands, £5,000."" The labor mem bers urged that the work should be pushed on with rapidly and the Treasurer assured them that no unnecessary time would be lost, but that it was desired to do the work on the betterment principle. The item passed at 4^7 a.m. and then there was a silent rash to the end of the resolution except that the Treasurer explained that the next vote was divided thus in the Ministerial mind:—Titianw to block holders, £30,000; to village settlements, £20,000; and to rural industries, £10,000. The amounts would, however, be adjustable within the total of £90,000. The reimwrnig- Bums were:—Purchase of land for working men's blocka, £10,000; produce stores, Port Adelaide, £5.000; and embankment, North Arm. £22,800. The necessary authorisation for buuuw iug £939,600 was then given, the re?oln taon was reported^ and die rnnridprstion of die report was faxed for tiro afternoon. The consideration of the amendments of the Legislative Council in the factories Bill was begun at 3.4) a.Dx, and the Minister of Edu cation explained **•** most of riw?T could be ac cepted without iiquring the measure. The fust half dozen were acquiesced in without com ment, but the desire to allow a woman or young person to work 100 boms (instead of 50 hours) overtime a year was refused, as was the work within a month of the birth of her child. Long talk occurred on the subject of the em ployment of children under 13 who'have air. Solomon and Mr. Grainger appeared for the Council in this matter, die latter moving a further amendment miking the employment contingent on the approval of the Minister of Education. He pleaded for the poor man with a l?rgefimily,sndpointmgtoMr.Coaeybeer,who was slumbering sweetly, said ""One honorable member has just got twins. He didn't want them, but he's got thorn."" There was a divi sion at 5.3 a-nu, and the amendment was beaten by IS vote to 10. Mr. Wood sleepily yawned as the heUs rang, but he got to the right side safely. Mr. Brooker, however, was stretched ipwai fable on a bench to the left of the Speaker, and had it not been fora coura geous rescue effected by the Attorney- General his vote would have gone with Mr. Grainger. Both gentlemen were called to die table and stated the manner in which they desired their names to be recorded. Mr. Solomon next wished to concede the principle desired subject to, the approval of bom inspector and Minister, and again there was a division. While the bells were ringing Mr. Grainger cried out to the labor members. ""You are unsympathetic. You dare not stand up against me on any platform. Yon are afraid of competition. It is a measly, disgusting, and dirty action. Pick your own audience in Adelaide and I'll turn it npiw* you on this point. Think of the widow with a large family.'' All this vituperation was effectless, and by 18 votes to 12 the amendment was lost. The remaining amendments were disposed of, and ats.3oajn. the reasons for objecting to those not accepted were sent up to the Council. The Adult Suffrage Bill was now called on in committee, but Mr. Howe threatened that if matters were pushed thai to die exclusion of certain amendments which he wishes to support he will vote against the third read| ing. The Premier remained firm, but when Mr. McPherson sought to disfranchise women bo far as the Legislative Council is concerned it was agreed to report progress and to sit again this afternoon. In order that members might not be turned adrift on the cold world too early Dr. Gockbura moved the second reading of the Bill providing for the payment of subsidies to freezing works, co-opex&tive wineries, compressed fodder factories, and other rural industries, and Major Castine Becured the adjournment of the debate until to-day. Next Dc Cockbum moved the second reading of theStandardTune?ill, under which Australia is divided into three zones, each having the same time. South Australia has one hour to herself, the eastern colonies have another, and West Australia has a third. In twelve minutes the Bill, which has already received the sanction of the Council, was whipped through all its stages, and so when the Act is proclaimed all South Australian clocks will have to be altered a. quarter of an hour. In bight minutes more the Northern Territory Jurors Bill, under | which the available panel is greatly widened, became law, and in six additional minutes the Bill introduced by Mr. Castine to give all Civil servants, whether on the provisional or the permanent list, the same privileges in respect to holidays, passed through all its remain ing stages. The electricity had just been turned off and legislators finished their busi ness in a dim religious light. Exactly at 6 o'clock the House rose. This afternoon work will begin again at 2 o'clock, and the Adult Suffrage Bill leads the way. Then come the Loan Bill, die Rail way Commissioners Bill, and die Lake Bouncy BilL The House will sit everyday this week both morning and night, as the Ministry are extremely anxious tonrorogue by Friday afternoon if possible. The Council is to begin work again tomorrow. This week's issue of the Australian Christian, World (Chrittian Colonist) contains two excel lent portraits, one of the new Anglican Bishop j of ltirerina, and the other of the Rev. Dr. Momerie, of London."

Waiting for the Supporters. Bill Read Third Time and Passed. 31 to 14. In the House of Assembly at 21 minutes to 11, Mr. Hourigan took up the debate on the third reading of the Women's Suffrage Bill, Mr. Brooker, who had the right to resume the debate, having given way to his colleague. The junior member of West Torrens strongly appealed to members to give women what was their just right. For thousands of years women had been treated little better than serfs. Mr. Johnson — Not lately. Mr. Hourigan — They had been taught to be pleasing to get husbands. Were our cultivated women less capable than the negro women of Wyoming? Mr. Solomon —Oh, divide, divide! (Laughter.) Mr. Johnson—Cultivated women don't want the franchise. Mr. Hourigan concluded a quarter of an hour's speech by predicting that women's vote would be used for the progress of the race. Mr. Butler rose ostensibly to reply to the wishy-washing arguments used by Mr. Solomon. Mr. Solomon—You are a striking instance of the necessity for woman's suffrage. Mr. Butler rejoiced. If the influence of woman had been so great upon the hon. member as it had been upon him the hon. member would be a better man. He was pleased to see the Register in its leading article that morning adhered to the views that paper had always expressed on this question— views which were in accord with his own. In order to fill up time till the supporters of the Bill arrived the member for Yatala was proceeding with a repetition of his second reading speech, and Mr. Johnson obliged him with a number of bulky Blue-books, promising to supply him with more when he had gone through these, so that he might effectively stonewall for the Government. At quarter-past 11 the baby of the House and the pet of the ladies, Mr. Griffiths, gave the Government and the Labour party a thorough ''slamming."" He first congratulated Mr. Butler upon having accomplished the object of the Government in assisting them to get their numbers. He regarded the Bill, which was carried by political jugglery, as a tribute and a payment by the Government to the Labour party. The Government had been bought cheap by the Labour party. The Labour party already controlled the Government, and he was surprised at the Government giving away to them. Mr. Archibald—Where do the Country party come in ? Mr. Griffiths—They were a bit split up, with a few waverers, prevaricators, and equivicators amongst that party, otherwise things would be different. Mr. Brooker —Bad whipping. Mr. Griffiths—Nothing of the kind. He trusted every specimen of honour and morality and virtue, who were making political tools of the women, would be left at the next elections. Legislation of the kind they were encouraging would make the colony totter on its own weight. The best thing would be to give the Labour party all they wanted—the thing would work out eventually. The Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Premier, and other Ministers had turned so much that he was forced to believe that there was too much personal interest, and that Ministers sold their conscience and their country when they got upon these Benches. The Speaker—I must ask the hon. member to withdraw that remark. Mr. Griffiths (hesitatingly)—I will say in some instances then. The Speaker—The hon. member must unreservedly withdraw it. Mr. Johnson—It has been said in the House of Commons often enough. Mr. Griffiths— Well, I will unreservedly withdraw it, but I believe it all the same. Mr. Ash—Say for the honour and position. Mr. Griffiths—All right. He did not wish to say anything against the senior member of the firm. (Laughter.) The Commissioner of Public Works would support anything. He believed that since he heard that American Eagle's which laid eggs. (Commissioner of Public Works—""You are better up in eggs than politics."" ""Eggs getting stale."") Having thrown up his bile, the handsome and cleverish young member made a final appeal to country members whether in supporting the Bill they were serving the interests of constituents or a mere morbid sentiment. At 11.35 the Hon. J. H. Howe moved that the House divide. This being carried, the question was put. The Ayers were sonorous and cheery, the Noes despondent out like muffled bells. The third reading was carried by 31 to 14. Mr. Griffiths to the majority—""Not half of you will get back next time."" The announcement that the Bill could pass was received with loud cheering. Mr. Grainger—""There's the hen convention."""
11,53659949,"The Register. ADELAIDE: WEDNESDAY, DEC. 19, 1894. THE PARLIAMENTARY ROAD TO RUIN.",Article,"South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)",19-12-1894,Article,1528,"Adelaide : Wednesday, Dec. 19, 1894. THE PARLIAMENTARY ROAD TO RUIN. Time is money, and the Assembly, taking its lead from the Government, has been notoriously spendthrift in that currency. With more than half the session wasted. Ministers are now muddling in prodigious haste work which they refused or omitted to propose when members had abundant leisure. Mr. Kingston may be only an indifferently good organizer, but there is probably method in his model of management. At any rate he will not fall into a faint if we suggest that his mind has been crossed by the thought that the less time there is for criticism the less criticism there is likely to be. The final passage of the Progressive Taxation Bill in the Legislative Council may be instanced in illustration of the wily tactics of the Ministry. The reason why the further treatment of that measure was delayed during so many weeks is now apparent. The Bill was carried through its last stage on Tuesday night because of the plea that it was too late in the session to press for amendments in it — that it was too late even to exhaustively discuss the important constitutional questions involved in the interchanges between the Houses regarding it. In other words, members of the Council were virtually forced to sacrifice principle in order to save a Bill whose salvation means the infliction of serious injury upon the country. Injury, too, inflicted not merely through the arrogancy and audacity of the Ministry ; or owing to the disorganization of the Opposition; or in consequence of the incapacity of some members to clearly com- prehend the issues involved ; but on account of the disgraceful perfidy of certain legislators who were elected as pledged opponents of progressive taxa- tion. This is the point for the people of South Australia to note particularly — this deliberate breach of solemn pro- mises made by public men. Against recreants thero is no protec- tion. The constitutional point dis- cussed last night in the Council need not be dilated upon now, but the debate showed the necessity for having a more distinct arrangement between the Houses concerning their relative powers in con- nection with money Bills. The under- taking of the Ministry to revive the mort- qage question next session is a proof that there is no intention to establish anything like fixity in land taxa- tion. The one-step graduation of 1894 will assuredly become the stair- case progression of other years. The event in connection with which the most dramatic demonstrations were made yesterday was the practical passing of the Woman's Franchise Bill into law ; and there was some reason for these displays. Any measure altering the Con- stitution in important respects may fairly be regarded as a history-making enact- ment. It will be well, while jubilates are being sounded by the Minister of Education with the Woman's Suffrage League as chorus, that the true genesis of this greatly controverted Bill should be understood. The legislative determination to enfranchise women represents in one sense a defeat for the Ministry. Not only have prominent members of the Cabinet year after year persistently opposed the principle of the Bill, but the form in which it is passed now is a form which twelve months ago they pronounced to be unjustifiable, and which they would not accept when recommended by Oppositionists to do so. Only by renouncing former opinions — only by doing this year what they would not do last year — only by yielding to the balance of voting power on the anti- Ministerial side of the House — have Mr. Kingston and his colleagues had their names associated with the successful inauguration of the new franchise. Recollection of this fact should affect the tune to be played presently when the time comes for the blowing of the usual fantasias on the Ministerial trumpet. Though we believe that the opponents of women's suffrage have taken fright unnecessarily—- though we share the opinion expressed yesterday by Mr. Griffiths that the extremists who expect to befool the woman voters will find that they cannot control the poli- tical force which they have created — yet the vehement antagonism to the Bill is quite natural. All serious legislative proposals, and particularly all constitu- tional changes, must be considered in relation to the Fabianistic devices of the men who dignify themselves with the title of the ' Advanced Party.' The policy of these gentlemen is to mount the Hill Difficulty by a deceptive but ever-ascending zigzag. If they should gain their ends the Woman's Franchise Act of 1894 will be followed in 1895 by Statutes modifying if not abolishing the distinction between the franchise for the Council and that for the Assembly. But they must not gain their ends. In the interest of the country they cannot be allowed to do go. The Woman's Suffrage Bill confers on the propertied voter in reference to the Legislative Council an addi- tional advantage which is perfectly warranted by the remarkably liberal interpretation put by some of the Returning Officers upon the qualifications entitling colonists to take part in elections for the Upper House. To alter the franchise for the Council in the way suggested would be to destroy and not reform our Constitution. Already South Australia possesses a curious anomaly in the shape of a so-called property representing Chamber which is more ''ultra democratic' than the House elected solely on the basis of manhood suffrage. Indeed, the abolition of the Council would be a gain to conservatism in the sense in which that much-abused term is defined in this colony. But while legislators are declaiming against the constitutional dangers attendant upon woman's suffrage many of them are lightly permitting the Ministry to encroach more and more upon the legislative func- tions of Parliament. The most noteworthy thing in politics at present is the distinct trend towards autocracy masquerading as democracy. South Australia is rapidly advancing in the direction of a dictator- ship. The Loan Bill proves most un- mistakably that Ministers boldly override Acts of Parliament and usurp legislative functions as the merest matter of course, and it seems that if it were not for the protests of the Press many of the people's representatives would not interpose even the trifling check which is applied to this usurpation. Last night's discussion in the Assembly, however, indicated that these protests are not unavailing. Mem- bers are not so studious as they ought to be of the laws which they pass, but when their attention is directed to breaches of those statutes some of them have the courage to object to such an evil. The pity is that, through lamentable and hopeless disorganization in the Opposi- tion, the members of that distracted party are as shepherdless sheep. One con- sequence of this is that the Assembly contains no effective combination for criticism. Another is seen frequently in the character of the attendance in the House. While the Ministerial supporters are always in their places — to talk, to stonewall, or to vote almost entirely in obedience to directions— the average Oppositionist comes and goes, acts or is passive, according to his own will and fancy. The Loan Bill which passed its third reading last night was so discreditable in some respects that even a number of Ministerialists revolted against accepting it unless with the alterations which have now been made. To have had the amount named in this measure reduced to tho extent of more than one quarter is a decided snub for the Ministry, but if there had been an alert Opposi- tion the Bill would have been cut down by one-half, or would not have passed at all this session. There is no actual neces- sity to rush it through, even though Ministers should ardently desire to have abundance of money available for socialistic experiments. And South Aus- tralia ought to be ashamed to ask the English capitalist to advance funds on the deceptive schedule to that Bill. That schedule has been ingeniously fudged- up in the same sense in which the Budget was fudged - up earlier in the session. Several Hues which appear in it would be erased at once if sound financial methods were insisted upon in Parliament; and we declare unhesitatingly that unless they be soon insisted upon the result will be disastrous to the credit of the colony and ruinous to its people. Take a single entry in the schedule to the Bill— 'Other Loan Works, £87,800' The money lender, interpreting this line in good faith, will conclude that the amount is to be spent in legitimate public works. But he will be misled. One-fourth of the sum has already been practically flung into the sea at St. Kilda; £50,000 has been and is being devoted by the Government to a mortgage business on exceedingly questionable securities ; £10,000 is to be absorbed in the purchase of land ; £5,000 is to be expended in the erection of a store at Port Adelaide. Is this ' borrowing for reproductive public works?' Or is it deluding the British capitalist ?"

Both Houses of Parliament sat on Tuesday, the Assembly starting at 10.30 in the morning and the Council at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The former sat till eleven minutes past and the latter till after half-past 11 at night. Both Houses sit this morning, the Council at 10.30 and the Assembly as 11 o'clock. Private members' business will have precedence. The order of Government business in the As- sembly is :— Factories, Friendly Societies, Railway Commissioners, Land, and Rural In- dustries Bills. FRIENDLY SOCIETIES BILL. The Legislative Councillors, who irately took business out of the hands of the Government last Friday, met at 2 o'clock on Tuesday prepared to do their share to put the finishing touches to an unsatisfactory session. The Friendly Societies Bill was quickly slipped through its remaining stages, with the addition of a proviso to clause 3 to give Societies which have not hitherto kept the accounts of different funds separate twelve months more in which to do so. This was proposed by the Hon. R. S. Guthrie at the behest of Friendly Societies. The second reading of the Bill in the Assembly will be moved to-day. PASTORAL BILL. The long-expected Pastoral Bill came up from the Assembly, and the Standing Orders were suspended so that the Chief Secretary might move the second reading. This he did in half an hour, explaining concisely the main provisions of the measure. Every clause, nay, every line, was a concession to the pastoral in- dustry and a liberalization of the present law. He was prepared to hear that too many restrictions were imposed. But half a loaf was better than no bread. ""This is not half a loaf,"" quoth the Hon. J. J. Duncan, and the Hon. J. Warren, "" It is not even a crust.'' The Chief Secretary — ""It is a very good meal any way. Every clause is a concession."" The Hon. J. L. Stirling — "" With nasty pro- visoes added."" Immediately the Chief Secretary sat down the Hon. J. L. Stirling secured the adjournment of the debate till next day. TAXATION BILL. Now came a lion in the path of peace — the message from the Assembly dealing with the Taxation Bill — notifying its refusal to con- sider the one which proposed to exempt mortgages from taxation. The President immediately made a short statement, the gist of which was that the Council had always con- tended and still contended that it had the right to make amendments in money Bills in the ordinary manner, and had only allowed such right to remain in abeyance so Iong as the compact of 1857 was adhered to. Con- sideration of the message was postponed until the evening, so that it and the President's statement might be printed. The Lords of South Australia were given fifty -five minutes to fortify themselves to settle an important constitutional point. Before this was tackled other comparatively minor points of difference had to be discussed. The first related to the definition of an "" absentee,"" and the Chief Secretary set the ball rolling by asking the Council not to insist upon changing ""South Australia"" to ""Australasia."" The Government had communicated with the Pre- mier of New South Wales, who said his Go- vernment intended to draw the absentee line at the boundary of the colony. Before any further advance was made the Chairman wisely pointed out to members that this was the final stage of the Bill. There could be no conferences. If the Council did not give way on every point the Bill would be lost. The Hon. E. Ward — ""I deny the position."" The Chief Secretary regretted the position, and would like to see the compact of 1857 amended, but that could not be done now. He appealed to those who believed in the broad principle of the Bill to support him. The Hon. Dr. Magarey set up the standard of "" Australia for the Australians"" coupled with ""Australians for Australia,"" and of course supported the amendment of the Council. The Hons. A. A. Kirkpatrick and D. M. Charleston would give way on the point for the sake of the Bill, but Sir E. T. Smith would not support a mean, contemptible clause. The Hon. E. Ward thought this could not be the final stage, as the Assembly had not finally dealt with the Council's suggestions. Besides the opinion expressed by the President would not hold good unless the Assembly had disagreed with all the suggestions of the Council. The Hon. J. V. O'Loghlin quoted from "" Black- more"" to quash Mr. Ward's contention. The Hon. J. L. Stirling urged members, come weal come woe, to stick by their amendments. The Chief Secretary— "" And ruin the Bill."" The Hon. J. L. Stirling described expediency as the looking-glass into which members were more and more inclined to look when trans- acting public business. Members should not put nails in the coffins of their privileges by abandoning their views. The Chief Secre- tary pointed out that all the eloquent pathetic speeches and mixed metaphors came from op- ponents of the Bill. It was decided not to insist upon the amendment by the following vote :— AYES, 9— Hons. Sir E. T. Smith, F. Basedow, J. Darling, J. J. Duncan, H. R. Fuller, J. L. Stir- ling, E. Ward, J. Warren, and Dr. Magarey (teller). Noes. 11— Hons. H. Adams. J. G. Bice, D. M. Charleston. R. S. Guthrie, W. Haslam, A. A. Kirkpatrick, G. McGregor, J. V. O'Loghlin, W. A. Robinson, W. Russell, and Chief Secretary (teller). Majority of 2 for the Noes. Pairs.— Aye— Hon. A. R. Addison. No— Hon. J. Martin. Now came another point. Should the dis- agreement of the Assembly as to the definition of ""mortgagee"" be considered at once or postponed until after the knotty point about the main question, which the Assembly refused to deal with, had been considered? The Chief Secretary asked for immediate consideration, and, as a preparation for the coming storm, read the following carefully worded statement of Government policy and promise: — ""In view of legislation in New Zealand there is much to be said in favour of the proposition to transfer a fair proportion of liability to land tax from the mortgagor to the mortgagee. The Government will endea- vour during recess to formulate a proposal on the subject, and hope to be able to introduce a short Bill which will commend itself to Parliament early next session."" This promise satisfied the Hon. J. V. O'Loghlin, who was the original mover in favour of exempting mortgagees. In no way could he help them now, as if, his amendment were insisted upon, the Bill would be lost. The Hon. Dr. Magarey claimed that if the Bill was thrown out the Government would have immediately to find some other means of raising taxation. Perhaps they would go for an all-round increase. The amendment was not insisted upon. On the question as to whether the Bill should be limited in its ope- ration to two years, the Hon. E. Ward and the Hon. Dr. Magarey ridiculed the reason given by the Assembly for not agreeing with the amendment. By refusing to allow the elec- tors at the next election to consider the matter the members of the Lower House showed that they were afraid to do so. The Hons. J. Warren and J. J. Duncan regretted that the Assembly and the Government had not the courage of their opinions. The following division gave the Chief Secretary a majority of two : — Ayes, 8— Hons. F. Basedow, J. Darling, H. R. Fuller, Dr. Magarey, J. L. Stirling, E. Ward, J. Warren, and J. Duncan (teller). Noes, 10— Hons. H. Adams, D. M. Charleston, R. S. Guthrie, W. Haslam, A. A. Kirkpatrick, G. McGregor, J. V. O'Loglihn, W. A. Robinson, W. Russell, and Chief Secretary (teller). PAIRS.— Ayes— Sir E. T. Smith, and Hon. J. Martin. Noes— Hons. A. R. Addison, and J. G. Bice. The amendment defining ""unimproved value"" was not given away without kicks from Mr. Ward, Dr. Magarey, and Mr. Duncan. Mr. Duncan thought the Government might have accepted it. It was doubtful whether existing legislation did not cover the point, and a case was likely to be tried to settle it. The carrying of the amendment would have prevented past taxation being interfered with. By 10 to 8 it was resolved not to insist. Now came ''suggestion No. 10, "" dealing with the exemption of mortgages, and the question whether, in refusing to consider it, the As- sembly had broken the spirit of the com- pact of 1857. The Hon. J. L. Stirling wished to move a general motion expressing regret that the Assembly would not consider the suggestion, the motion to be sent in the form of a message to the Lower House, but the President ruled that such a motion could only be moved in the whole Council. Mr. Stirling, continuing his argument, said the Council had equal power to legislate on money Bills except as to introducing them. The Assembly had put too limited an interpretation upon the compact. They should have either assented to or disa- greed from every suggestion. The words of the compact of 1857 should have been para- mount over the Standing Orders of the As- sembly. The Council should stand on its rights. He moved the postponement of the amendment, so that at the proper time the message he wished sent to the Assembly might be put. The amendment should be sent back to the Assembly. The Hon. J. V. O'Loghlin agreed that the rights and privileges of the Council should be held, but if the Council went out of its way to cause points of difference they would not uphold their privileges. The Hon. Dr. Magarey thought the Assembly had got into a jumble, for which there was no need, because they might if they wanted to have negatived the Bill. The Council should not be bound by the compact if the Assembly did not stick to it. The Chief Secretary characterized this as a constitutional storm in a teapot. The Assembly had met the Council cour- teously and graciously, and might have met them in a very different way. Under the question of the definition of ""mortgagee,"" the whole question was considered by the Assembly, and they said they could not agree with it. The As- sembly had sent a courteous message, and the Council should not go behind that message to ascertain what was done. The message con- tained no infringement of the compact, as it said some suggestions were accepted and others rejected. To find any flaw in the action of the Assembly they had to go behind the message, and look at an early print of the records, which might be altered. It was preposterous for the Council to make a fuss, as the Assembly could not go back on its own solemn message, according to which it had considered the Council's suggestion. Mr. Stirling wanted to reply, but the Hon. F. Basedow at 11.15 applied the closure. By 8 to 6 tho Commit- tee decided not to postpone consideration. Then the Hon. E. Ward asked the Chaieman for a Presidential ruling as to whether the Assembly had violated the famous compact. The Chairman said earlier in the day he had expressed the opinion that the Assembly should consider the suggestion. Inferentially the message from the Speaker said they had ; the records said not. Which was right he was not prepared to say. Mr. Ward— But they give reasons for not considering the sugges- tion. The Chairman — The reasons have no- thing to do with it. The message says the Assembly would not accept the suggestion. By 8 to 6 the Committee agreed not to insist upon its amendment. The last amendment was not insisted upon. Thus the Council gave way on every point, and the Bill is ready for the Governor's signature. FACTORIES BILL. The Factories Bill message was next con- sidered. The Chief Secretary asked the Council not to insist upon increasing the limit of overtime from fifty to 100 hours. A stern fight ensued with the old battle cry between town and country. The Labour members, led by the Hon. D. M. Charleston, thought that in these days when so many people could not find work overtime should be discountenanced. The country representa- tives, with the Hons. E. Ward and W. Haslam in the van, contended that it would be most inconvenient to limit the overtime as pro- posed. Mr. Charleston finally admitted that the country had claims, but he pleaded for sympathy for city workers. By 12 to 10 the Council decided to insist upon its amendment. It was also resolved to insist, on grounds of delicacy, upon striking out Clause 16, which says a woman shall not be employed in a factory within a month after confinement. The Labour Party were divided as to whether the provision for children under thirteen working in factories by special permission should be insisted upon. Mr. Charleston thought they would be better working under restraint in a properly ventilated factory than running about the streets. The amendment was insisted upon. An even division was taken as to whether the Council should insist on striking out clause 25, and the President casted with the Ayes, ""to uphold a former decision of the Council."" The Assembly will consider the Council's message to-day. CIVIL SERVICE BILL. The Civil Service Amendment Bill was received from the Assembly and taken charge of by the Hon. J. V. O'Loghlin, who will move the second reading to-day. ELECTORAL BILL LOST. Owing to the sudden adjournment on Friday the Electoral Bill slipped off the paper and the Chief Secretary moved the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable him to restore it. There were several object- ing voices, who considered it waste time to bother about the measure this late in the session, but the Chief Secretary ex- plained that he wanted it restored so that next session it might be taken up under the Lapsed Bills Continuance Bill. There were 12 Ayes and 10 Noes, and inas- much as an absolute majority of the Council was required to deal with this, a consti- tutional question, the Bill fell into the abyss of obscurity. The Chief Secretary was annoyed, and audibly accused more than one member, whom he had asked to "" favour'' him of shabbiness. LICENSED VICTUALLERS BILL. The Opposition, flushed by success, tried, on the motion of the Hon.E. Ward— ""That the Chairman do now leave the chair""— to mas- sacre the Licensed Victuallers Bill. The following division was taken : — Ayes, 8— Hons. F. Basedow, J. Darling, J. J. Duncan, H. R. Fuller, J. Martin, J. L. Stirling, J. Warren, and E. Ward (teller). Noes, 14— Sir E. T. Smith, Hons. H. Adams, A. R. Addison. J. G. Bice, D. M. Charleston. R. S. Guthrie, W. Haslam, A. A. Kirkpatrick, Dr. Magarey, G. McGregor, J. V. O'Loghlin, W. A. Robinson, W. Russell, and Chief Secretary (teller). These numbers meant a majority of 6 for the Noes. As it had been arranged that the Women's Suffrage Bill should be considered at 5 o'clock there were only a few minutes available to deal with the Licensing Bill. The definition of "" bona-fide lodger"" was further wracked, and with the agreement of both parties the reference to an intending Sunday night lodger was struck out. The Hon. F. Basedow moved to reduce the qualifying Sunday travelling distance from ten to five miles. Sir Edwin Smith was ridiculing the clause when progress had to be reported. THE NEW WOMAN VOTER. In the Assembly at 10.39 on Tuesday morn- ing Mr. Hourigan took up the debate on the third reading of the Women's Suffrage Bill, Mr. Brooker, who had the right to resume the debate, having given way to his colleague. The junior member of West Torrens strongly appealed to members to give women what was their just right. For thousands of years women had been treated little better than serfs. Mr. Johnson — Not lately. Mr. Hourigan — They had been taught to be pleasing to get husbands. Were our cultivated women less capable than the negro women of Wyoming ? Mr. Solomon — Oh, divide, divide! (Laughter.) Mr. Johnson — Cultivated women don't want the franchise. Mr. Hourigan concluded a quarter of an hour's speech by predicting that women's vote would be used for the progress of the race. Mr. Butler rose ostensibly to reply to the wishy - washy arguments used by Mr. Solo- mon. Mr. Solomon— You are a striking instance of the necessity for woman's suffage. Mr. Butler rejoiced. If the influence of woman had been so great upon the hon. member as it had been upon him the hon. member would be a better man. He was pleased to see the Register in its leading article that morning adhered to the views that paper had always expressed on this question — views which were in accord with his own. He regarded the measure as purely con- servative. Mr. Johnson obliged Mr Butler with a number of bulky Blue-books, promising to supply him with more when he had gone through these, so that he might effectively stonewall for the Government. At a quarter past 11 the baby of the House and the pet of the ladies, Mr. Griffiths, gave the Government and the Labour party a thorough ""slamming."" He first congratulated Mr. Butler upon having accomplished the object of the Government in assisting them to get their numbers. He regarded this Bill, which was carried by political jugglery, as a tribute and a payment by the Government to the Labour party. The Government had been bought cheap by the Labour party. Mr. Archibald — Where do the County party come in? Mr. Griffiths — They were a bit split up, with a few waverers, prevaricators, and equivicators amongst that party, other- wise things would be different. Mr. Brooker —Bad whipping. Mr. Griffiths— Nothing of the kind. He trusted every specimen of honour and morality and virtue, who were making political tools of the women, would be left at the next elections. Legislation of the kind they were encouraging would make the colony totter on its own weight. The best thing would be to give the Labour party all they wanted — the thing would work out eventually. The Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Premier, and other Ministers had turned so much that he was forced to believe that there was too much personal interest. and that Ministers sold their conscience and their country when they got upon these Benches. The Speaker — I must ask the hon. member to withdraw that remark. Mr. Griffiths (hesitatingly)— I will say in some instances then. The Speaker — The hon. member must unreservedly withdraw it. Mr. Johnson — It has been said in the House of Commons often enough. Mr. Griffiths — Well, I will unreservedly withdraw it, but I believe it all the same. Mr. Ash— Say for the honour and position. Mr. Griffiths— All right. He did not wish to say anything against the senior member of the firm. (Laughter.) Having thrown off his bile, the handsome and cleverish young member made a final appeal to country members whether in supporting the Bill they were serving the interests of constituents or a mere morbid sentiment. At 11.35 the Hon. J. H. Howe moved that the House divide. This being carried, the question was put. The Ayes were sonorous and cheery, the Noes despondent like muffled bells. The third reading was carried by 31 to 14. Mr. Griffiths to the majority— Not half of you will get back next time. Mr. Grainger — There's the hen convention. The announcement that the Bill could pass was received with loud cheering. The following is the division list :— AYES, 31—Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Caldwell, Castine, Catt, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Gillen, G. G. Hawker, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Howe, Jen- kins, Kingston, Lake, McDonald, MacGillivray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Price, Randell, Scherk, Wood, and Cockburn (teller). NOES, 14 —Mr. Blacker, Sir John Downer, Messrs. Gilbert, Giles, Grainger, Hague, E. W. Hawker, Homburg, Johnson, KelIy, Landseer, McDonald, Riddoch, and Griffiths (teller). Majority of 17 for the Ayes At 5 o'clock the Chief Secretary, with ap- proving smiles from the ladies in the Gallery, moved that the Council agree with the new clause which enables women to vote by post. The Hon. E. Ward pressed for ""time"" before they made an ill-considered leap into a bottomless pit. ""What for?"" asked the Hon. D. M. Charleston : "" to find whether the Conservatives or Liberals put it in?"" Mr. Ward wanted to know how the voting went in the Assembly, but the President said the Council officially had nothing to do with that ; they had to consider the clause as it stood. Mr. Ward objected to the proviso, which was put in to nullify the new clause. He moved to strike out the proviso relating to the de- claration which a woman who wishes to vote by post must make that she resides more than three miles from a polling-place. The Hon. J. J. Duncan supported him—"" I believe in giving all women the right to vote through post,"" he affirmed ; but the Hon. G. McGregor caused a smile when he blandly remarked— ""You don't believe in women voting at all."" Mr. Duncan was bound to admit that Mr. McGregor was correct. He did not. There had been no mandate from the country. Members were selling the electors. The clause would bear wide construction. What was meant by the state of a woman's health? If she had a headache or pricked her finger? The Chief Secretary — "" That should suit you."" Mr. Duncan— "" That shows the absur- dity of putting it in."" Finally he regretted that the Bill was so nearly passing. There were functions for men and functions for women. (Loud cheers from the Labour corner.) Woman's function was — (Hon. W. A. Robinson— ""To work in factories"")— to stay at home and not go to public meetings. The Hon. W. A. Robinson — "" Lay the tele- phone on for the women to vote."" Several members joined in a discussion which had a tendency more than once to become a second- reading debate. The Hon. G. McGregor charged opponents of the measure with in- sincerity, but had to withdraw the abstract noun. He substituted inconsistent. He had no doubt of the gallantry of members. They would have enough thought for the ladies to mark their voting-papers for them. An attempt was made, after an hour and a quar- ter's talk, to apply the closure, but an even vote was taken, and the Chairman had to go with the ""Noes."" The Hon. J. Warren appealed to humanitarians to vote for the amendment. It would be indelicate to ask women to make a declaration as to their state of health. Mr. Ward's amendment was negatived on the following division : — Ayes, 10—Hons. Sir E. T. Smith, A. R. Addison, J. Darling, J. J. Duncan. H. R. Fuller, J. Martin, W. Russell, J. L. Stirling, J. Warren, and E. Ward (teller). Noes, 11— Hons. H. Adams. J. G. Bice, D. M. Charleston, E. S. Guthrie, W. Haslam, A. A. Kirkpatrick, Dr. Magarey, G. McGregor, J. V. O'Loughlin, W. A. Robinson, and Chief Secretary (teller). Majority of 1 for the Noes. Then the Hon. E. Ward, in the interests of women, asked those who did not wish women to horde at the polling booth with the brute men to support an addendum to the clause, "" provided that separate voters shall be pro- vided for women voters."" This was negatived, the clause agreed to, and now all that remains to enact adult suffrage is for Her Majesty's assent to be given to the Bill. HEAVY-HEARTED BORROWING. The debate on the Loan Bill in the Assembly on Tuesday exhibited new-born interest and heavy hearts in borrowing. In moving the second reading at 11.40 a.m. the Treasurer said the Government had intended that no fresh Loan Bill would be needed for three years. If the reduction in the Govern- ment proposals had been much greater than the £200,000 on the pastoral improvements, the Government would have been obliged to submit another Loan Bill next year; but unless any great undertakings were decided upon, there would be no necessity for another Bill even in the next two years. As to the provisions in the Bill for the issue of bonds or inscribed stock, three years ago a portion of the 1890 stock was sold to the Savings Bank with the expressed engagement that the Bank would be permitted to take bonds in lieu of inscribed stock, and the prin- cipal interest would be made payable in Ade- laide instead of in London. To carry out that agreement provision was made here. There was another alteration of the form of issue, where in clause 3 they provided for the issue of a loan for a fixed deposit of ten years, with the right of repaying as the treasurer might direct after the expiry of ten years. If the House considered a longer period was neces- sary the Government would not be averse to increasing the terms. But judging by events in other countries the ten years' limit would not prejudice the Government getting a fair price for their stock. They might expect lower interest as the years passed, and with the possible reductions it might be thought that 2½ per cent. would suffice. At a quarter to 12 Mr. Grainger moved the adjournment of the debate, as he had not read the Bill, the printer's ink was wet. It contained a new principle. The Government opposed the adjournment. Mr. Grainger being defeated by 31 to 13, in a splendid out- burst of honest indignation remarked that fool's rushed in where angels feared to tread. The recent division showed the extreme necessity for the entire reform of Parliament. Not five members had read the Bill. Though tax- payers were distressed, here was a proposal to borrow a million of money, and members were not allowed time to even read the Bill. Mr. Homburg — The Bill could have been brought down months ago. Mr. Grainger — Certainly. On the Estimates members with a retail mind would spend hours on a forage allowance. Yet the expenditure of a million was rushed through with indecent and expensive haste. No wonder the outside public sneered at Par- liament. The conduct of the Ministry justi- fied the Council in rejecting the Bill. He ex- plained the difference between bonds and stocks, and said the Treasurer was not game enough to move the Consolidated Stocks Bill. The Treasurer — I would have been too glad if you had not wasted time. Mr. Grainger vehemently repudiated the suggestion, and blamed the Ministry and Ministerialists for blocking business. The issue of bonds sprung upon them in Mr. Holder's speech was un- sound and obsolete, and inconvenient to deal with. The Treasurer — The Savings Bank want bonds simply because it saves expense. Mr. Grainger maintained that the four previous loans floated at a discount were illegal. Interest should be paid quarterly. Clause 2 provided that the stock should be redeemable at par in all or by instalments at the option of the Treasurer after six months' notice. Every financial authority would laugh at the idea. How would he manage it. The Treasurer — I will tell you in Committee. Mr. Grainger ridiculed drawing by lot for varying stock. They could do it with bonds because they could heel mark them. If they had a surplus and the bonds were cheap it would be a good thing to buy them back. The Treasurer— What, traffic in our stock? Mr. Grainger — Yes. The English Government did it. The Treasurer — No. Mr. Grainger— The Commis- sioners of Public Debt did. When we had those Commissioners they could do it. He argued for interminable stock. Consolidation at 3 per cent. would save South Ausralia £50,000 or £60,000 a year. At the time we consolidated our stock we could raise the money in the colony. What did the Labour members think of no public works policy for three years? Clause 3 giving the form of the bonds was evidently obsolete. Referring to clause 6 he observed that very little criticism was given officers who derived their salaries from loan. Clause 8 was meant to deal with the arrangement with the Savings Bank, but it ought not to be carried in this way. People in England would not understand it, as there was no reference to the Bank. He had no faith in sinking funds. There was no investment whilst the sinking fund was accruing. It would be preferable to borrow cheap and pay off the dear money, but the issue of annuities was even more prefer- able. The sitting was suspended from 1 to 2 p.m. Upon resuming Mr. Grainger advised the Government to start Post-Office Savings Banks. Amidst cheers he censured those who having purposes to serve tried to cause a run upon the Savings Bank. Clause 8 should be excised and a short Bill passed giving stock holders option to convert stocks into bonds or vice versa. The colony wants a Cass- andra, and has the character in Mr. Giles, who repeated his dolorous warnings against the policy of financial drift. Optimistic Mr. Butler followed, though he demurred to the costliness of the Beetaloo and other works. Ponderous Mr. Homburg, like other lawyers in the House, has a weakness for finances, and may some day bud forth into a Treasurer. The unraised balances should be issued in interminable stock. ln the ab- sence of the members for Gladstone and Wal- laroo, Mr. Homburg noted that those districts invariably profited by Loan Acts. Enough had been spent in dicing up that mudhole Port Pirie. (Laughter.) Let it silt up and give Port Germein a tramway. There would be enough water in the Port Pirie creek for barges if they wanted water traffic. (Laughter.) Port Augusta was a grand Government natural port with splen- did wharfs. Mr. Foster smiled approvingly. The Commissioner of Crown Lands (confi- dently)— But have you seen Port Broughton? (Laughter.) Mr. Homburg— Port Broughton will be wiped off the map soon. (Oh.) Only £200 out of the £3,000 asked for was wanted for deepening outports. There was £6,000 in hand for deepening Port Adelaide, from which temporary transfers could be made for con- tingencies. The Port members looked glum, and the Treasurer with pious horror in his tones interjected — Do not sanction that sort of thing ! With pity, Mr. Homburg, looking over his glasses — Now, what's the use of the Trea- surer talking like that. He has done it so often before that his protest does not become him. Later on in the afternoon the member for Gladstone patriotically defended Port Pirie. Mr. Homburg noted that £3,000 more than was required was asked for the South-Eastern drainage works. Mr. Hague considered the ten-years redemption too brief, and doubted the expediency of completing the Beetaloo works. Mr. Caldwell, who was prevented earlier in the day from making a general attack on "" Hansard,"" repeated his complaint, and expressed the hope that Mr. Grainger's financial speech to-day would be fully reported. He regretted that ""Hansard"" reporting recently had been so unsatisfactory in the sense that members' speeches were so much curtailed. Probably the contract had been taken too low, and a saving was sought to be effected by condensing the reports. Injustice to members was pos- sible where the remarks of members were shortened in this way. He regretted that no- thing had been done for the unemployed. He knew one gentleman willing to take a quarter of a million of the loan. Mr. Moule at 4.19 complained that the Treasurer had not put the position of the Loan Fund properly before the House. ""In regard to"" Mr. Gilbert— Mr. Gilbert uses that phrase about a score of times a minute— he wanted more information, and like Oliver Twist's caterer, the Treasurer looked aghast. Mr. Grainger backed up the demand, and the Treasurer retired from the contest with good intentions — he would meet requirements in Committee. Mr. Gil- bert enumerated national mistakes to justify pinching the Treasurer. At 5 o'clock Mr. Ash protested against works being put in the schedule which should not be paid for out of loan. If items such as loans to blockers were put in the schedule he did not think the English people would lend the money. Mr. Landseer, in his philosophic pessimism and Pickwickian grandiloquence, travelled outside the Bill. Mr. Riddoch advised the use of the brake to the financial coach. The Happy Valley Waterworks might be reduced by £50,000 or £60,000. At present it was unnecessary to borrow any further money for pastoral improvements, as the Government had £253,000 available. The Hon. A. Catt concluded some time ago that the small community of South Australia had borrowed suffi- cient. Certainly money should be obtained cheaper. Considering the Beetaloo scheme was only about two-thirds completed it would be most unwise to discontinue the reticulation. The ten-year redemption stock was unwise. Silent Mr. Kelly broke another long spell of peace by advocating a reduction in nearly all the items. He fancied toll-gates and wheel taxes would be a good thing. Mr. Brooker praised Kilkenny steel pipes. Referring to the steel-pipe fad Mr. Howe described the over- worked Engineer-in-Chief as a ""Booh Pah."" The mental transposition indicated that the long sittings were overtaxing Mr. Howe's brain. Shortly after the tea hour arrived as an oasis in the Sahara of debate. On the House resuming the majority of members were either in the lobbies or on the marble steps enjoying the evening air, and disinclined to speak to a thin House. Major Castine called attention to the few members present, and a quorum had to be made up. After ten minutes' further contribution to "" Hansard"" by the member for Wooroora, the Treasurer rose to reply. He agreed with much Mr. Grainger had said, particularly with his conclusions. Having read a lot upon the subject, and formed suggestions based on the experience of the other colonies and other parts of the world, he very much regretted having to lay the Consolida- tion Bill aside. His firm conviction was that no large saving was to be realized by entering into any large scheme of loan conversion, because the stockholders had a right to payment of interest at the covenanted rates until the terms expired. In no further loans should the Government bind themselves for any long period. Suppos- ing they issued 3 per cent. stock at £92 or £93, would not the fact of the possibility within ten years of the loan being paid off at par induce tenderers to tender at a higher rate than if they thought redemption was further distant? It was quite possible to apply the principle of redemption to inscribed or registered stock as well as to bonds. Sup- posing the Treasurer found himself with £250,000 in hand, he could notify the holders of the stock or bonds that 25 per cent. of the loan would be repaid. Mr. Grainger had said this was not prac- ticable. He held that it was. They ought to issue stock in going to London, but it was better to deal in bonds locally. In every case they should do what would best suit their customers. Replying to remarks that the Government were piling up the burden of taxation, he pointed out that in 1891 £2 12s. 6d. represented the taxation per head of the population, and year by year the total per head had been reduced until last year it stood at £2 4s. 10d. per head. The Government pledged themselves not to raise any of the money before it was wanted. At quarter-past 8 the second reading was carried. In Committee, Mr. Moule in the chair, Mr. Grainger on clause 2, for reasons previously stated, moved to excise ""binds or."" Negatived by 28 to 6. Mr. Grainger, having called attention to the obscurity of the clause, the Treasurer introduced verbal alterations. An a compromise between Mr. Grainger and Mr. Holder "" twenty'' years for redemption was substituted for ""ten."" An amendment determined that the option as to payment of principal and interest in London or Adelaide was to be fixed at the time of sale. From clause 3 the Treasurer struck out ""£3 10s."" in the 12th line and ""paid on"" in the 15th and 16th lines. Con- sequent amendments were made in clause 4 dealing with application of moneys. In clause 8 the Treasurer inserted, after ""proper"" in line 3 ""and as he may have agreed to sell to the Savings Bank of South Australia."" Clause 9 passed. On the con- sideration of the schedule Mr. Ash moved to include the schedule in the Parlia- mentary Paper. The Treasurer said it was unnecessary to give a Iot of detailed information to the bondholders. Amendment negatived by 28 to 8. On the motion of the Treasurer the words ""and equipment"" were inserted after ''railways."" Mr. Hague moved to reduce the railway accommodation account by £100,000 with the view of using the unexpended balances sub- ject to a Loan Transfer Bill next year. The Treasurer said if all the loan balances were mopped up this year as the hon. member suggested and any reduction were made a loan for the South- Eastern drainage would be necessary next year. Mr. Giles predicted that the South- Eastern people would never agree to the betterment principle. Sir John Downer contended that it was a downright bad principle for Parliament to authorize a loan and allow the Government to borrow when it suited them. At 9.50 p.m. Mr. Hague's proposition was carried by the acting Chairman's casting-vote, the voting being 17 on each side. To stop the further reticulation in the Beetaloo water district Mr. Giles moved to reduce waterworks— £319,000— by £120,000. The Hon. J. H. Howe and Mr. Grainger protested against the amendment, which the Treasurer also opposed. Mr. Ash, Mr. Burgoyne, and Mr. Foster entered a pro- test against the protective duty on pipes. Mr. Brooker again championed the local manufac- turers. Mr. Archibald remarked that while the pipe industry had found employment for people it had given a fortune to the manufac- turers. Mr. Riddoch could see no adequate return from the Beetaloo works. He would like to see small reservoirs extending over a large area of country. Mr. Giles's amend- ment was negatived by 20 to 11. On the item, £50,000 construction of roads, Sir John Downer thought it was time they stopped this expenditure from loans. The Treasurer explained that he had been flooded with applications, and the money would be spent as good claims came in. It was only fair that districts without railways should have con- sideration. Mr. Brooker wanted the expen- diture spread over five years. The Treasurer replied that that could be provided for upon the Loan Estimates. Sir John Downer and Mr. Ash protested against the item. Mr. Poynton reminded the Knight about his address, which blamed the Labour party for starving the roads. Sir John retorted that his views as to expenditure out of revenue were different to that out of loan. A little by-play followed between the Knight and the Labour party about their antagonisms. The item was passed. Mr. McPherson proposed to reduce improvements on pastoral leases, £200,000, by one half. Major Castine went one better by moving to strike off £150,000. Both amendments were negatived, and the item was passed. Mr. Ash moved to reduce ""other loan works £87,800"" to £20,000. He gave his reasons previously. The amendment was negatived by 24 to 6, and the item was passed. The Bill as amended was taken through its remaining stages and passed. Friendly Societies' Procession at Nor- wood. — By an inadvertence the Good Templars were not included in the list of those who formed the Friendly Societies' procession at Norwood on Sunday afternoon. They headed the procession."
13,25744796,"TUESDAY. DECEMBER 18, 1894. WORKING OVERTIME.",Article,"The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889 - 1931)",18-12-1894,Article,1276,"TUESDAY. DECEMBER 18, 1894. WORKING OVERTIME. The legislation-factory on North-terrace does not come within the purview of the proposed new Act. Though the dan- gerous machinery of Parliamentary go- vernment requires to be safeguarded as well as any other, there is no provision for it. Factories must be sufficiently ventilated, but the same necessity is not invariably recognised in respect of Bills. The benefits of the eight-hours system are not extended to sweated legislators who are punished with overtime at the end of a session for their culpable dilatoriness and waste of good oppor- tunities at the beginning. Night and day the Parliamentary machine is kept going. No arrangement is made for alternating shifts, and naturally enough all but the most robust and industrious are asleep at their posts about half the time. It will be a mercy to the public if the result of these conditions is not to provide the public with legislative shoddy. Bills in their last stages need dexterous finishing touches that a House ex- hausted by late sittings is little likely to give them. New measures— and there is a stream of them— which pour down upon a House already in dismay at the formidable accumulation of arrears must pass, if at all, after hasty and imperfect examination. At 5 o'clock in the morning only a few mem- bers whose vigilance is sleepless are awake enough to extend to amendments in Bills from the other House the careful consideration they deserve. Yet this is how our laws are made. On Friday and Saturday about sixteen hours at a stretch were given to the loan pro- posals, but when votes for hundreds of thousands of pounds were going through, worn-out legislators, no longer troubled by the waking nightmare of the loan, were to be seen sprawled out on their cushions, dreaming—it may be—of the coming prorogation and a happy release. Usually the night's dissipation does not bear the morning's reflection. Fortunately the record for Saturday morning was not wholly bad. The majority of the House somnolently nodded over the schedule, but a sufficient number kept awake to cut the total down from £1,139,500 to £959,500. The reduction by a moiety of the proposed vote of £400,000 for pastoral improvements might reason- ably have been expected in view of the fact, which we pointed out last week, that without any new vote at all the Treasurer has practically £255,281 to go on with. He admits now that with the additional vote as reduced, and using the unexhausted authority under the Loan Act of 1892, all liabilities on this account can be met up the end of 1896. His re- sources for two years will be not far short of half a million, and a request for more than this did not indicate much confidence in the efficacy of the legislative scheme for inducing pastoralists to surrender their right to compensation from the State. Assemblymen, recuperated by a brief interval of rest, were in good form when they met yesterday for another trial of strength on the Women's Suffrage Bill. There is really only one logical method of dealing with the question of female enfranchisement. Is it true that in the nature of things there is no reason for the political qualification of one sex that does not equally apply to the other ? Do men enjoy any civil rights or privileges which women may not with equal justice claim ? Are the disabilities of women founded merely on irrational prejudice and an utterly mistaken view of the limitations of their province imposed by the laws of human nature ? Those who are unprepared to answer these questions favorably to the woman's side of the con- troversy must, until they are satisfied, consistently oppose woman's suffrage altogether. Those who claim to be of the opposite way of thinking must be re- garded, if they propose half-measures, either as lacking the courage of their con- victions, as failing to perceive the conse- quences of their own contentions, or as being animated by other motives than those which they profess. The proposal, no longer made, that only widows and spin- sters should have the vote, and that married women should be deliberately excluded, virtually involved an acknowledgment— fatal to the whole argument for female enfranchisement—that sex must inevi- tably be considered in the distribution of political privileges; that indeed, in the case of one sex, completeness of sexual life is an insuperable bar to electoral qualification. Similarly legislators who now say that only propertied women should vote cannot be credited with thoroughly believing that the natural rights of women are the same as those of men. If they do so believe, why would they place unpropertied women in a different and worse position from that of unpropertied men ? The suspicion is instantly aroused that their support of a partial scheme recognising only women of property is inspired less by a concern to do justice to a sex said to be wrongfully excluded from the franchise on untenable sexual grounds than by an unconfessed desire to strengthen the property vote. We have always urged that the funda- mental question is the sexual one. Regard women simply as a class, and there is no argument worthy of a moment's examination in favor of denying them the suffrage. Regard them as a sex, with an appropriate sphere of sexual activity into which voting for and sitting in Parliament—the two things are complementary—cannot be intruded without injuriously deranging normal sexual relations, and the whole aspect of the question completely changes. Considering this aspect, the familiar catch-phrases telling us that women, like men, are taxed, that therefore they ought to be represented, that it is unjust to re- quire them to obey laws the makers of which they have had no share in select- ing, simply miss the mark. Women's suffrage, viewed in the light in which we have suggested that it should be placed is, seen to be a problem the correct solution of which requires the study of psychological and physiological laws, and the ascertainment of their real significance. Few disputants probe it as deeply as that. Even among men whose ideas are quite conservative as to the division of public and domestic responsi- bilities between the two sexes, antagonism to the proposed expansion of woman's sphere is often more instinctive than strictly ratiocinative. But whether or not the inner consciousness of these returns a wrong answer to the question of enfranchising women, and whether or not the reasoning is sound which holds such enfranchisement to be at variance with the laws of sex rightly interpreted, the fact remains that modern democracy has resolved that the female franchise shall be granted. The good point of the Bill before the Assembly yesterday is that, at all events, it is an honest Bill. It does not play with the real issue. It is founded on a principle which, whether right or wrong, is applied with fearless logic. The committee discussion was a sort of triangular contest between the whole-souled supporters of women's suffrage, faint-hearted friends plead- ing for irrational compromises, and out-and-out opponents willing to wreck the measure on any point. Ministers failed in their efforts to get the Bill through committee without amendment; but the alterations made are not such as seriously to jeopardise its passing. The third reading stage was not reached until several supporters whose votes are essen- tial had left the House. Consequently there was no alternative but to adjourn the Bill again, and opponents may be ex- pected to make a final rally against it before the last division is taken."
14,25744774,"THE PARLIAMENT. HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY. MONDAY, December 17. The STEAKER (Sir Jenkin Coles) took the chair at 2 p.m. CIVIL SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Hon. C.",Article,"The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889 - 1931)",18-12-1894,Article,10216,"THE PARLIAMENT. HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY. MONDAY, December 17. The SPEAKER (Sir Jenkin Coles) took the chair at 2 p.m. CIVIL SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL (Hon. C. Kingston), in reply to Mr. GRIFFITHS, said he had not the honor of introducing the Civil Service Act Amendment Bill, but the Govern- ment considered the form in which it passed was unobjectionable. So far from inflicting an injustice on Civil servants it would give them important privileges. If, however, the Go- vernment found anything wrong with the Bill they would endeavor to amend it in the Legislative Council. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL, in answer to Mr. Griffiths, said the Civil Service Bill contained an extension of rights and not a limitation of privileges, but he would look into the matter. SITTINGS OF THE HOUSE. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL, in answer to Mr. Brooker, said the Government in- tended to ask the House to meet early next day and to sit that evening as well. Mr. CALDWELL asked if the Government would discourage sitting beyond 11 o'clock on any evening ? The ATTORNEY-GENERAL replied it was the intention of the Government to ask the House to do whatever was necessary for the purpose of completing business by the time indicated. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL, in reply to Mr. Giles, said notwithstanding the short time at the disposal of the Legislative Council he considered it necessary to sit late every evening. PASTORAL IMPROVEMENTS. Mr. GRAINGER asked what was the amount the Government expected to pay for pastoral improvements between July 1, 1895, and June 30, 1896? The TREASURER (Hon. F. W. Holder) had already given the amount required for the ordinary year, but he had not the figures for the financial year. The TREASURER, in reply to Mr. Foster, said the £400,000 asked for under the proposed loan would not have covered all liabilities for pastoral improvements, but it would have met all claims to the end of 1897. He had, how- ever, consented to accept £200,000 in place of the larger sum, as that would suffice to the end of 1896. The TREASURER, in reply to Mr. Moule, said as the papers regarding the Loan Esti- mates were correct he did not intend to alter them. The TREASURER, in reply to Mr. Moule, said that as the 1-^u-u;l.oi-..-.^i ;>-. the Act of 1892 of which £120,000 was for the payment of pastoral improvements had not been stated the money was Ij-jl a^ailaK.- .'..r XI:- p-.r -pos.-. The TREASURER, in reply to Mr. Grainger, said the cash in i.jti'i : -r -,i..\:ii""'ii. of pastoral improvements was 1X...>->■"", and there was power to raise £150,000 more. THE MACARTHUR FOREST PROCESS. The COMMISSIONER of CROWN LANDS (Hon. P. P. v.i11.-n•. in reply to Mr. E. W. HAWKER, said the Government had entered into a contract with the representative of the MacArthur Forest Company, which contract expired on November 1. The Commissioner of Crown LANDS, in reply to Mr. McDonald, said payment of royalties for the MacArthur Forest cyanide process was not being made by the Government pending the result of the appeal case. ADULT SUFFRAGE BILL. In committee. Clause 3. Extension of franchise. Mr. GRAINGER said in some cases mem- bers had changed their opinions on this subject considerably. The Minister of Education on a former occasion had said that the franchise should be extended to women gradually. That was in 1889, and in 1893 the Minister was very strong in favor of the referendum, and had said that a grave constitutional change like this should not be effected without consulting the country. Then the Commissioner of Crown Lands in 1890 took a stand very adverse to the proposal, but apparently he was not of the same view now. In 1890 the Attorney-General had deserted views on the referendum as well. Generally the Govern- ment had swallowed their opinions. Never had he heard the financial position of the country discussed by women, who gene- rally talked about fashion, babies, and ser- vants. The agitation for female suffrage showed that the race was becoming effeminate. Repudiation might be deemed advisable, as the colony was so deeply in debt, and if that extreme were resorted to the blame would be thrown on the women if they were first given the vote. Man had, ever since the time of Adam, been apt to throw the blame on some woman. To a very large extent representa- tion should be on the basis of population, and if female franchise were granted the city con- stituencies would demand more members. There would be a good deal of trouble as to registration of voters, as there was always difficulty about discovering a woman's age. There had been no demand by ladies to sit in the Legislative Council as they had a right to. (The Attorney-General "" Who says that they have a right to sit in the Legislative Council?) The Constitution Act allowed them to, and if the question had been such a burning one it was surprising that some lady had not tested the right. The Government could easily arrange for a plebiscite on the matter at the next election. (Mr. Wood —""They vote at municipal elections now."") In Robe ward of the city there were 246 female voters and only 46 voted, or 23 per cent., while the percentage of male voters was 36. With regard to the petitions presented to the House he maintained that half the people who signed them did not know what they contained. Mr. GILES moved to add the words ""who have a property qualification necessary to entitle them to a vote for the Legislative Council."" All great reforms should be brought about gradually, but the Bill went to an ex- treme at once. There was enough talking in the House now, and he could not imagine what it would be like when women entered Parliament. Women who possessed property should certainly have the right to vote, because they had an interest at stake and were denied privileges which were accorded to their male servants. The Bill would give large centres of population increased power, and he was altogether opposed to centralisation. Un- less the amendment were carried he would vote against the third reading. Mr. CALDWELL would support the amendment, because he hardly thought the time had arrived when we should adopt a universal suffrage. He would not, however, go to the extent of Mr. Giles and oppose the Bill if it were not carried. The women who were thrifty and assisted their husbands to accumulate property should be entitled to recognition. Mr. BUTLER said if they agreed to the amendment they would be introducing a pro- perty qualification into elections for the House of Assembly. Women would not take a less liberal view of politics than men, who often through sudden access of fortune turned from radicals to conservatives. (Mr. Johnson —"" I know a case the other way round."") The hon. member seemed to think that the cap fitted him, and he had better wear it, as he could afford to do. Mr. JOHNSON said manhood suffrage was as yet on its trial, and there were many men who were no more qualified to exercise the franchise than animals. (Mr. Batchelor —"" The national ass?"") Some members were natural asses. Because he respected women he thought it un- desirable that the franchise should be extended to them. There was far more to be said in favor of conceding the vote to women with a property qualification than of extending that privilege to the whole sex without any limita- tion whatever. He did not think the country constituencies could have examined this so- called liberal measure very closely, as other- wise it would be apparent that its immediate effect would be to at least double the voting power for the city and large provincial towns. He was convinced that a majority of those women whom he should like to see endowed with the franchise did not want the concession asked, because they plainly foresaw that its result would be to dethrone woman from the pedestal on which men had placed her. He would vote against the clause and against the whole Bill. Mr. HAGUE could not support the amend- ment of Mr. Giles. If he did so he would be violating one of his hustings pledges. He had not committed himself to support woman suff- rage, but had stated that if he did support it he would give womanhood suffrage for the House of Assembly, and the same property qualification for the Legislative Council as men now possessed. He had not voted for the second reading of the Bill because he thought the proposal premature. The German women of his constituency were entirely opposed to woman suffrage. He took exactly the same position now in regard to this measure as he had taken last year. The Hon. J. H. HOWE thought the adop- tion of the amendment would be a great blow to the privileges and rights of women. Mr. Johnson had argued that a constitutional change of the magnitude contemplated by the Bill should not be undertaken by the House at the pre- sent juncture. Whilst he did not fear the calami- ties depicted by Mr. Johnson he did think that a constitutional reform of such importance should be first submitted to the people. He had never heard a substantial case made out against conferring the franchise on women if women wanted it, and he believed a great num- ber did want it. But what right had the mem- bers of the House to alter the constitution without first consulting the people? That was the position taken up last year by the Minister of Education, and that was the position he himself took up to-day. Mr. GRAINGER asked Mr. Giles to tem- porarily withdraw his amendment, as he had a prior one to propose. Mr. GILES asked leave to withdraw his amendment. Amendment withdrawn. Mr. GRAINGER moved to strikeout all the words in line 6 and the first three in line 7. He understood that Mr. McPherson had changed his opinion with regard to moving the amendment he had moved last year, and which he had indicated his intention of moving this year. The effect of the amendment would be to confine the franchise to elections for the Assembly. A little later on Mr. McPherson said he believed in the referendum. Mr. Archibald was also in favor of the referendum. (Mr. Archibald—""' You are doing this to kill the Bill."") He would vote for it with the referendum. If all the supporters of the Bill were coming back why should they put the country to so much unnecessary expenditure? Mr. CASTINE could scarcely understand the conduct of hon. members who were moving amendments apparently with the desire of wrecking the measure. If the Government agreed to the referendum it meant that women could not have the privilege of voting until the year 1900. He had not been able to speak on the second reading this year, but he had no reason to be dissatisfied with his speech of last year. He would stick to his opinions of last year. (Mr. Price ""Don't pair, though."") It was those who like him- self supported the principle of this Bill last year who deserved the credit. As to his pairing last week the Minister of Education asked him not to pair and he declined to do so. Dr. Cockburn said—"" It doesn't matter :we have a majority any way."" (The Minister of Education—""l only asked you not to pair."") Mr. Short came to him later on and asked him to pair with him and he did so. He pledged himself to go for the Bill as it was on their files. The Bill was experimental legis- lation, and so far the principle here had not been altogether a success. He referred to the effect of woman's suffrage at Lyrup Village Settlement, where it was stated to have led to family disunion. The Commissioner of Crown Lands — "" The trouble simply was that some women were voting who were not villagers and the others objected."") He feared that the intention was to pass the present Bill and then amend it next year in the direction of allowing the wife of a propertied man to vote for the Legislative Council. He was opposed to any such thing. Men now were in the habit of making over property to their wives. He saw no reason why a woman with property should have all the privileges arising from the possession of a vote. Women took the place of men in many cases. There were 465 women employed as farmers, 68 as squatters and dairy farmers, and 134 as sellers of dairy produce in South Australia. One sixth of the employed women in South Australia were independent. Personally he favored women's franchise, but some of women's existing privileges would be taken away if it were granted.

He objected to women of property being given a vote that was denied to their poorer sisters. Mr. JOHNSON said it was clearly intended to reduce the property qualification and then to abolish it altogether. A good many people were not fit to use the franchise in the various constituencies. The Upper House, it was in- tended, should eventually be abolished alto- gether. Mr. BROOKER moved ""That the com- mittee do now divide."" This was declared carried, but Mr. SOLOMON called for a division, which resulted as follows: — Ayes. 17 Messrs. Archibald, Batchelor, Burgoyne, Butler, Conneybeer, Foster, GiIbert, Hague, Hooper, Hourigan, McGillivray, McPherson, Poynton, Price, Scherk, Wood, and Brooker (teller). Noes. 22 The Attorney General, Treasurer, Commissioner of Public Works, Minister of K«i>j. air .ii. Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Hons. G. C. Hawker, J. H. Howe, Messrs. Ash, Blacker, Caldwell, Castine, Cock, H. E. Downer, Giles, Grainger, F. W. Hawker, Johnson, Kelly. McDonald, O'Loughlin, Pack- ham, and Solomon (teller). Majority of 5 for the Noes. Mr. SOLOMON could not understand why Mr. McPherson had changed his opinion with regard to the matter. It reminded him of a story told of a member of the House of Lords, who on being asked whether all the eloquence he heard did not compel him to change his views replied ""Yes, but not my vote."" While the labor party refused to give a vote to women with property for the Legislative Council in the same way that they gave it to men, they would lower the quali- fication for the Legislative Council. Their sole object seemed to be to increase the rights of the working men, who paid less than any class to the taxation of the colony. (Mr. McPherson — ""More."") On what did they pay ? (Mr. McPherson — ""On what they eat and drink."") They only paid through the Customs about 30s. a head, while the richer people paid considerably more. (Mr. McPherson — ""What number are there, though?"") Man- hood suffrage was the greatest gift in the way of constitutional government that could be given to the people, and it was quite broad enough without going to the ex- treme that the Bill proposed. The women of the colony as a whole did not want this exten- sion, and it was being forced on them through the agitation of a few women and the labor party, who considered that it would increase their power. The country would be out- numbered, and producers and farmers, who had to bear the brunt of taxation to meet the interest on money expended to give employ- ment to those out of work, would not thank their representatives for voting for this Bill. There were the village settlements, the day labor on the Museum fittings, and the St. Kilda recla- mation works. (Mr. Batchelor — ""Who started those works ?"") The present Govern- ment did, as the Downer Government only authorised the preliminary survey. The ques- tion should be remitted to the whole people of the colony, and if a majority decides in its favor he would support it. He did not favor the amendment, as if they gave women a vote at all it should be for both Houses, but the result would be that plausible gentle- men with teetotal and other fads would be returned. He denied that at the last elections the question was a test one, as it was simply a joke run by a few larrikins in the back of the hall at the meetings. The real question was taxation, but why were those members who stated that it was adult suffrage afraid to test it at the next elections ? It was a matter which would affect the whole future history of the colony, and the question of the cost should not deter the Govern- ment from referring it to the referendum. It would not cost more than a thousand pounds. Was that paltry amount to be weighed in the balance against a great constitutional change ? He would oppose Mr. Grainger's amendment and would support any amendment which would have the effect of referring this important matter to the women of South Australia and the electors of South Australia. Failing the application of the referendum to the proposed change he would do his best on the third reading to block the Bill. The question was put in the form ""That the words proposed to be struck out stand"" and was declared carried, whereupon Mr. GRAINGER called for a division, which resulted as follows: Ayes, 32—The Attorney-General Treasurer, Commissioner of Public Works, Commis- sioner of Crown Lands, Hons. Sir John Downer, G. C. Hawker. Messrs. Ash. Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Caldwell, Castine, Cock, Foster, Gilbert, Giles, Hague. E. W.

Archibald, Batchelor, Blacker, Coneybeer, H. E. Downer, Griffiths, Kelly, McGillivray, McPherson, and Grainger (teller). Majority of 22 for the Ayes. Mr. GRAINGER asked members who had voted with him last year why they had suddenly changed their views ? He would oppose the amendment of Mr. Giles. The amendment of Mr. Giles was declared negatived, and the mover called for a division, which resulted as follows:— Ayes, 6—Messrs. Caldwell, H. E. Downer, Gilbert, E. W. Hawker, Short, and Giles (teller). Noes, 34—The Attorney -General, Treasurer, Commissioner of Public Works, Commissioner of Crown Lands, Hons. Sir John Downer, G. C. Hawker. J. H. Howe, Messrs. Archi- bald, Ash, Batchelor, Blacker, Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Castine, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Grainger, Hague, Hooper, Hourigan, Johnson, McDonald, McGillivray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Packham, Poynton, Price, Scherk, Solomon, Wood, and the Minister of Educa- tion (teller). Majority of 28 for the Noes. The clause passed. Clause 2. Qualifications. Mr. GRAINGER asked the Minister of Education to explain the meaning of this clause. The MINISTER of EDUCATION said that clause 1 conferred the right on women to vote for representatives to sit in Parliament, and clause 2 provided the machinery for exercising that right. Mr. GILES contended that the effect of the clause would be to deprive women resident in the country from exercising their votes. The MINISTER of EDUCATION said that the argument of Mr. Giles was entirely disposed of by the experience of New Zealand. Mr. FOSTER protested against Mr. Giles trying to throw dust into the eyes of the com- mittee. Women in the country would be able to exercise their votes just as readily as men. Mr. CALDWELL thought this clause gave women the right to sit in Parliament. Mr. BURGOYNE differed with the view taken by the previous speaker. The clause simply conferred on women the right to vote subject to the same qualifications as were im- posed on men. Mr. CALDWELL moved to strike out ""hereby"" in line 1, and to insert ""in the matter of voting"" in lieu thereof. The amendment was lost and the clause passed. Clause 3 passed. Clause 4. Short title. Mr. GRAINGER moved to add to the clause the following words:—""But shall not come into operation until a day to be fixed by proclamation issued by the Governor and pub- lished in the Government Gazette, and no pro- clamation shall be issue until the Chief Secre- tary shall have certified to the Governor that on a reference to all the electors of the House of Assembly and all the adult women of the province a majority of such persons who voted on the question have affirmatively answered the question, ' Do you wish the franchise to be extended to women?' "" Mr. CALDWELL said that last session the Bill had contained a similar provision. He had voted against the referendum on that occasion because he had thought the work of years would be thrown away if an appeal was made to the people in the form provided for in that measure. He had been twitted by the Premier, sneered at by the Treasurer, and the women had censured him severely for it. He would vote for the referendum. (The Minister of Education—"" What, introduced by an enemy ?"") He now appeared to be a friend. (The Minister of Education —""Do you think me an enemy?"") No; he believed the Minister of Education had been consistent all along. He had been so unkindly treated that he would now vote for the referendum. (Mr. Wood— "" You are vindictive."") No, he was not. Mr. BATCHELOR said the proposal in last year's Bill was that two questions should be submitted to the referendum—one referring to each House, and if it was proposed in the same form this year he would support it. Mr. WOOD was astonished at the speech of Mr. Caldwell, who now proposed to play right into the hands of the enemies of the Bill. He hoped the hon. member would reconsider his decision. Mr. GILES said Mr. Caldwell had per- sistently supported women's franchise since he came into the House. He (Mr. Giles) was opposed to the referendum last year, because the women in the towns could vote much more easily than those in the country. He would oppose the referendum again. Mr. GRAINGER asked that the amend- ment should be put in two separate questions. Mr. McPHERSON said there would be no objection to the referendum if it were done constitutionally. He was sorry the Govern- ment had not seen fit to introduce a Bill allow- ing the people to call for the referendum, which was not a thing to be foisted on the people when they did not ask for it. The women of Australia had undoubtedly asked for the vote. Mr. HOMBURG supported the amend- ment. He had voted for the referendum last year. Why did the Government drop it this year. (The- Attorney-General—""It lost us the Bill last year."") He had heard it said in the House that the Ministry were not in earnest in this matter, but he did the Premier the justice of believing that when he brought a Bill down he desired to carry it through. All he wanted the Government to do was to introduce the Bill in the same form as last year. (The Minister of Education—""So that it may share the same fate!"") Just so. There was a majority for the Bill and the Government had deserted the referendum. He wished to know why the referendum had been abandoned. Mr. BUTLER said if this amendment were carried he would vote against the third reading. The Minister of Education said there was no doubt that the referendum was responsible last year for the wreck of the Bill. He hoped that those who supported the ex- tension of the suffrage to women would stand shoulder to shoulder in opposing the introduc- tion of all foreign matter. Let them vote for the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill. The Hon. J. H. HOWE said the same argu- ments about sticking together had been ad- vanced by the Minister of Education last year. On that occasion it was the referendum and nothing but the referendum. A reference to the people on a constitutional question of this kind was a right thing to grant. He would sooner place his reputation in the hands of the ladies than of the gentlemen of the colony. At 6.30 p.m. the sitting of the committee was suspended for an hour. On resuming. The Hon. J. H. HOWE said it was inte- resting to read the speeches of the Minister of Education on the subject of women's suffrage. Last year he was rallying members round the referendum, but now he wished them lo cross over and vote against it. The Minister of Education last season was most eloquent in his advocacy of the referendum, and he had not shown this year why a change should be made. The Minister asked members to be false to the votes of last year. He was not going to be played with to please any Ministry. He did not wish it to be understood that if this amendment were not carried it would shake his allegiance to the Bill, because he would in any case vote for the third reading. Mr. PRICE congratulated Mr. Howe upon having become a convert to the principle of the referendum. He could not, however, sup- port it himself, because he believed the enemy were at work endeavouring to destroy the Bill. The circumstances had changed since last year, because the largest petition ever presented to Parliament had been placed before members in favor of adult suffrage, while the largely- attended meetings of the Women's Christian Temperance Union had proved that women thoroughly understood how to conduct business. The amendment having been declared negatived Mr. GRAINGER called for a division, which resulted as follows :— AYES, 18 The Hons. Sir Jenkin Coles, J. H. Howe, Messrs. Batchelor, Blacker, Cald- well, H. E. Downer, Gilbert, Griffiths, Hom- burg, Johnson, Kelly, Landseer, MacLachlan, Moule, Riddoch, Short, Solomon, and Grainger (teller ). Noes, 29 The Attorney-General,Treasurer, Commissioner of Public Works, Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Hon. Sir John Downer, Messr. Archibald, Ash, Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Castine, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Giles, Hague, E. W. Hawker, Hooper, Hourigan, Lake, McDonald, McGiilhivray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Price, Scherk, Wood, and the Minister of Educa- tion (teller). Majority of 11 for the Noes. Clause as amended passed. Mr. HAGUE moved to insert the following new clause: —3A. ""1. Every female voter shall be entitled at any time after the issuing of the writ to apply for a certificate in one of the forms, as the case may be, of the schedule A to ' The Absent Voters Electoral Act, 1890,' from the returning-officer that she is registered as a voter upon the electoral roll and entitled to vote at the forthcoming election. 2. The application hereinbefore mentioned need not contain the matters set forth in paragraph 3 of the application in schedule A and B of the Act No. 577 of 1893. The provisions of ""The Absent Voters Electoral Act, 1890,' and the said Act No. 577 of 1893 shall, except so far as inconsistent with the provisions in subsections 1 and 2 of this clause, apply to every female voter.'' It had been truly said that women in the country would be placed at a disability as compared to those residing in the city and suburbs, while on polling day there were always a number of people congregated around the booths, and while he did not think discourtesy would be shown to women many of them would not like to pass through the crowd. This would be particularly so at the earlier elections, allthough afterwards he thought few women would trouble to take advantage of the provisions of the Absent Voters Act, but would prefer to present themselves at the polling booths. The MINISTER of EDUCATION said the object of the Bill was to place women on ex- actly the same footing as men, but this clause was against the whole scope of the Bill. Mr. Hague himself admitted that it would not be availed of after the first elections, while they had the experience of New Zealand to prove that women would attend the elections. This was not the Bill in which to introduce the clause, which would strike a blow at the ballot. The Hon. J. H. HOWE was surprised at the Government opposing such a reasonable and humane proposition. Women were liable to illnesses which men were not, and to refuse them the relief contained in the clause would be unmanly in the extreme. Mr. McDONALD said the action of the Government proved that their desire was to place the country at a disadvantage and to in- crease the power of the city constituencies. The principle did not upset the secrecy of the ballot, while it would be a great advantage to women, who in many cases would have to travel 10 and 20 miles. Mr. POYNTON said there was a Bill already before the Legislative Council which contained all that Mr. Hague desired. The proposal would abolish the ballot, and he would oppose it. Mr. HOMBURG said there was nothing in the clause to compel all women to avail themselves of the provisions of the Absent Voters Act, as it was permissive. It therefore in no way amounted to open voting. It was ridiculous to urge that they should not amend the Electoral Act, because the Bill already stated that all Constitution and Electoral Acts were amended so far as might be neces- sary to give effect to the Act. The question was whether women disabled physically or otherwise from attending the polls should be allowed to avail themselves of the provisions of the Absent Voters' Act. (Mr. Poynton—""You want to kill the Bill."") The amendment would have no effect upon the fate of the Bill one way or another. Would any member say that he intended to vote against the Bill if the amendment were in- serted? (Mr. Archibald—""Will you vote for the third reading if it is put in."") Nothing would bribe him to vote for the Bill. (Mr. Archibald —""Do you believe in vote by ballot."") Has the Absent Voters Act injured that principle? (Mr. Batchelor—'""Yes, very considerably."") No one had said so. (Mr. McPherson—""Women in the city are under the same disability as those in the country."") Not at all. In the city there was only a little distance to walk. In the country a woman might have to travel many miles in a German waggon. Mr. PRICE said that statistics showed that the proportion of male voters who exercised the franchise in the country was greater than in the city, and it would be the same under women's suffrage. There were always plenty of vehicles to carry people about in the country. Did the women in the country have more children than those in the city? He strongly deprecated this eternal cry of city versus country. If a woman was fit to go for her voting paper, as was necessary under Mr. Hague's amendment, she was fit to go to the ballot-box. In town, where the elections usually took place on a Saturday, the shop- women, factory girls, and general servants would practically be disfranchised because they would not be able to leave their work. He was not prepared to sacrifice the ballot. (Mr. Homburg—""You sacrificed it last year for the sailors. "") Yes, and he knew the danger then. Mr. FOSTER said the amendment struck at the root of the Ballot Act, and so he would oppose it. When women did not value the vote sufficiently to go to the polling booth, when able to do so, they should not be enfranchised. The matter should be dealt with by an extension of the Absent Voters Act. Sir JOHN DOWNER said the argument for the extension of the sufferage was founded on chivalry towards women who possessed a mental and moral right to the vote. Then let the exercise of the right be made as little inconsistent with the variance of the sexes as possible. It was a gross evasion to argue that the concession asked for should be given under another Bill. If it was a right thing let it be made here and now. Every member would sooner that his lady relatives voted in the way suggested than amid the bustle of the open polling-booth. There was no more danger to the secrecy of the ballot than under the Absent Voters Act. He thought the amendment was a proper one both as regards the sex and because legislators should endeavor to facili- tate the carrying out of the law in the most convenient way. He moved to add to the new clause after ""voter"" in the first line, ""whether she has reason to believe that she will be absent from the electoral district or not."" Mr. ASH said the amendment must be carried as it is. There could be no compromise, as suggested by Mr. Foster, who desired to discriminate between ladies in a certain con- dition and others. This would cast a most invidious duty on the returning-officer. Other ladies besides Queen Mary made mistakes. Mr. GRAINGER objected to the acceptance of the Government promise to deal with this matter in the Electoral Bill. No reliance could be placed on Government promises. The deli- cate women should be considered as well as the screaming sisterhood. The result of women's suffrage would be a great surprise to the labor party. Was a modest woman to be compelled to enter a public-house to vote ? Yet those were the very women whose votes were most needed. Men could wait their time to go into the polling-booths, but women could not do so. Women did not yet know how to vote, and there would be more informal votes than ever before if women voted. Mr. SOLOMON said the Government had allowed the Electoral Bill to drop off the notice paper of the Legislative Council, and yet they spoke of making provision for meet- ing this difficulty in that Bill. The Legisla- tive Council had agreed in that Bill that a voter in the Northern Territory might take advantage of the Absent Voters Act if he de- clared he would be 15 miles from a polling- place on the day of voting. Mr. Hague pro- posed to give women somewhat the same privileges as the Government had proposed in the Electoral Bill and the Government actually opposed it. The truth was the Ministry did not want the women of the country to have a vote; that was their little game. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said they could excuse some heat in Mr. Solomon, who sat so close to the Treasury benches on which he would never have a seat. The Minister of Education had suggested that the amendment proposed was one which should be dealt with in the Electoral Bill, and he appealed to hon. members such as Mr. Homburg whether con- stitutional changes are not always dealt with in a measure of this sort, while the neces- sary machinery is provided in an Electoral Act. As to the so-called dropping of the Electoral Bill, the fact was that that measure would be on the notice-paper of the Legislative Council to-morrow or the next day. It was temporarily off because of the stupid conduct of some members of the Assembly which gave some cause to what had been jocularly called a ""strike"" in the Legislative Council, with the result that it lapsed temporarily and did not at present appear on the notice-paper. We were proud of our ballot system, which would probably become the law of the civilised world, but if we extended in an unlimited degree the Absent Voters Act there was room to doubt whether it would not be done at the expense of the untrammelled freedom of the voter. It was a question of the balance of convenience, but we should scrutinise very closely anything striking at the root of our system of ballot. The Bill in question provided that those within 15 miles of a polling-place should have the power of voting by post, but the case there was very different to the proposal here, which was that whether the woman lived next door to the polling-booth or not she should vote through the post. It might mean that from the day the writ was issued every woman might be made the victim of touts and canvassers, who would worry her into recording her vote through the post-office as the canvasser de- sires. The canvasser would practically go off with the woman's vote in his pocket. Then the influence of the head of the house would be brought to bear in such a way on the women and servants of the household that they would have practically no option left. Women were, no doubt, less capable than men of undertaking arduous journeys to the polling- booth, and in the Electoral Bill they could deal satisfactorily with that question. He asked hon. members to stay their hands until that Bill was before the House. He asked the Chairman to put the first paragraph of the clause first. Mr. RIDDOCH said the discussion had proved the undesirability of women going to the polls. Mr. BURGOYNE was strongly inclined to vote for the new clause. He was in favor of giving every reasonable facility to persons to record their votes. The new clause went too far in some re- spects, whilst it did not go far enough in others. He agreed with the Attorney-General that it would be more convenient to embody the provision under discussion in the Absent Voters Act than to incorporate it in this Bill. On the distinct promise of the Attorney- General that the Absent Voters Act would be brought forward at an early date, when this provision could be inserted, he would support the Government. Mr. BATCHELOR said Mr. Grainger had asked why the labor party were not going to sup- port this clause. One reason was that it would tend to violate the secrecy of the ballot-box, and anything in that direction was most dis- tinctly dangerous. The question of people being allowed to vote through the post-office was never raised until it was proposed to give women a vote for the House of Assembly. The point was now raised by opponents of the Bill who were anxious to secure its defeat. Mr. CALDWELL supported the clause be- cause he had always favored the principle it embodied. People of honor could vote as con- scientiously through the post-office — which method it was urged would upset the secrecy of the ballot—as they did under the existing system. Mr. LANDSEER claimed that if a fair re- presentation in Parliament was to be secured people in the country should have equal facili- ties with those in the city and suburbs of re- cording their votes. Mr. BROOKER said in the country districts nearly all the people had conveyances, and the women could vote as easily as the men. Every- thing possible was being done by its opponents to hamper the progress of the Bill. An attempt was being made to break down the spirit of the Ballot Act. No person, whether man or woman, should be debarred from exer- cising the franchise on the day of election. The record of New Zealand showed that there was no need for Mr. Hague's clause. Mr. HAGUE accepted Sir John Downer's amendment. He was not playing any little game. He had proposed this clause, because it would be inconvenient for women to vote at the booths. They had been told if they passed this clause that the ballot would be a complete farce. That was wrong. If this Bill was to be passed women should be allowed to vote in some such way as he had indicated. Mr. CASTINE intended to vote for the clause, but if that were lost he would still vote for the third reading of the Bill. Mr. PRICE was as anxious as any member of the House to guard the honor of women. He still held that there was a good deal of danger in the clause introduced by Mr. Hague. Girls in factories and shops might be com- pelled by their employers to let them know for whom they were voting. Husbands, too, might coerce their wives into voting as they wished. Mr. JOHNSON said members who objected to this clause in the Bill did so because they saw that there was a chance of the country being more largely represented under it. There was no reason why modest women should be compelled to attend the polling- booth. He did not agree with Mr. Brooker that an employer should be prosecuted for preventing his employes from leaving his ser- vice to record their votes. Mr. CALDWELL said Mr. Price referred to the action of Mr. Riddoch in altogether un- warrantable terms. Mr. Riddoch had no in- terest in any pastoral country in South Aus- tralia, and it was wrong to accuse him of having an interest to serve because he placed his experience of other colonies at the disposal of the committee. The CHAIRMAN said the words were not objected to at the time or the hon. member would have had to have withdrawn them. Mr. BUTLER moved — ""That the com- mittee do now divide."" Negatived. Mr. SOLOMON said Mr. Price could not have read the Absent Voters Act or he would have known that the postmaster before whom the declaration was signed would not know how the voter exercised his or her franchise. Under the existing Act an elector of the district of West Adelaide had only to cross King William- street into East Adelaide on election day to be able to claim the privilege of the Absent Voters Act, and yet members would not grant the same right to female electors in large districts where they might have to travel many miles to get outside their district. Mr. SHORT failed to see how the clause would strike a blow at the secrecy of the ballot, seeing that we already had the principle admitted in the Absent Voters Act, and this Act had received the support of those who now objected to giving the same privilege to women who in country districts would have in some instances to travel 20 miles to record their votes. Mr. CONEYBEER moved ""that the com- mittee do now divide."" Negatived. Mr. BLACKER said in nine families out of ten the females would go with the males, so that the Bill would make very little difference to existing legislation. The Absent Voters Act was intended for outside districts, and unless this clause was agreed to women in those districts would disfranchised. The Hon. J. H. HOWE said it was a de- liberate misstatement to say that members who supported the clause desired to wreck the Bill. He challenged the labor party to prove that one member who supported the clause was animated by such a desire. Such an accusa- tion came with ill grace from the labor members, who had changed their opinion with regard to the referendum. Out of the 80,000 women who would probably register themselves some would be at times incapaci- tated from voting, and they should be given at such times the opportunity to vote. The clause would, if passed here, quickly pass the other House. It was hypocrisy to say that this was not the proper place to insert the clause. Mr. RIDDOCH said he supported the clause, because, although he was op- posed to the Bill, he wanted to make it as workable as possible. He was surprised at the remarks made concerning him by Mr. Price, and he would like to say that he was in no way interested in pastoral matters in South Australia, and he was not interested in any vote he gave on the Pastoral Bill. Mr. CONEYBEER moved ""that the com- mittee divide."" Carried. Sir John Downer's amendment was carried, and the first subsection of Mr. Hague's new clause was put as amended and declared carried. Mr. BROOKER called for a division, which resulted as follows:— Ayes, 23—The Hons. Sir Jenkin Coles, Sir John Downer, J. H. Howe, Messrs. Blacker, Butler, Caldwell. Castine, Giles, Grainger, Griffiths. E. W. Hawker, Homburg, Johnson, Kelly, Lake, Landseer. McDonald, Mac- Lachlan, Moule, Riddoch, Short, Solomon, and Hague (teller). Noes, 20—The Attorney -General, Treasurer, Commissioner of Public Works, Commissioner of Crown Lands, Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Brooker, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Hooper, Hourigan, McGilliyray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Price, Wood, and the Minister of Education (teller). Majority of 3 for the Ayes. PAIRS-Ayes, Messrs, Gilbert and H. E. Downer: Noes, Messrs. Scherk and Burgoyne. The MINISTER of EDUCATION moved to add to subsection 2—"" But in lieu thereof the applicant shall declare that she is resident more than three miles from the nearest polling- place, or that by reason of the state of her health she will probably be unable to vote at the polling-place on polling day."" Mr. SOLOMON, on a point of order, asked if a division had not been ordered on the whole clause? The ATTORNEY-GENERAL maintained that the division was ordered on the amend- ment of Sir John Downer. The CHAIRMAN said the motion put from the chair was on the amendment of Sir John Downer, and the division was on that. Sir JOHN DOWNER said his amend- ment was agreed to without any division. The CHAIRMAN said that did not alter the case. The division was taken as to whether the words should go in. Sir JOHN DOWNER denied that. The question on which the division was called was whether subsection 1 should be inserted. Tile ATTORNEY-GENERAL said the amendment of Sir John Downer was before the committee and then somebody moved "" That the committee divide,"" and that was carried on the voices. The CHAIRMAN said Mr. Brooker called for the division, and perhaps he would state his intention. Mr. BROOKER said he understood that the amendment of Sir John Downer was agreed to without division. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said the question was whether the amendment of Sir John Downer was carried before Mr. Brooker moved "" that the committee do now divide."" He contended it was not. The CHAIRMAN said Mr. Brooker moved "" that the committee divide."" and then he put Sir John Downer's amendment, which was carried on the voices. The Minister of Educa- tion is in order. The MINISTER of EDUCATION said the amendment would meet the considerations of distance and incapacity to attend. Mr. GRAINGER asked what was the par- ticular virtue in three miles, and how could the voter know what the state of her health would be? It seemed a premium on lying. The subsection was declared negatived, and the MINISTER of EDUCATION called for a division, which resulted as follows:— Ayes, 23—The Attorney - General, Trea- surer, Commissioner of Public Works, Commissioner of Crown Lands, Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Brooker, Butler, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Hooper, Hourigan, Lake, McDonald, McGillivray, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Price, Wood, and the Minister of Education (teller). Noes, 20—The Hons. Sir Jenkin Coles, Sir John Downer, J. H. Howe, Messrs. Blacker; Caldwell, Castine, Giles, Grainger, Griffiths, E. W. Hawker, Homburg, Johnson, Kelly, Landseer, MacLachlan, Moule, Riddoch, Short, Solomon, and Hague (teller). Majority of 3 for the Ayes. Pairs—Ayes, Messrs. Scherk and Bur- goyne; Noes, Messrs. H. E. Downer and Gilbert. The section as amended was inserted. Sections 2 and 3 were inserted. Mr. McDONALD moved the insertion of the following new clause:—""Until otherwise provided by Act, no woman shall be capable of being elected to Parliament as a member of either House thereof."" That was certainly necessary. The MINISTER of EDUCATION asked Mr. McDonald not to press the clause, which was unnecessary, as women did not aspire to seats in Parliament. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL, in answer to Sir John Downer, said, according to clause 1 women being entitled to vote had a right to a seat in Parliament. Mr. CALDWELL would support Mr. McDonald, as his amendment was needful. Mr. SHORT hoped members would not support Mr. McDonald. Mr. CASTINE said if Mr. McDonald's amendment were carried he would have to vote against the third reading of the Bill. The clause was declared negatived. Mr. McDONALD called for a division, which re- sulted as follows: — Ayes, 8—The Hon. Sir John Downer, Messrs. Butler. Caldwell, Giles, Hague, Lake, Landseer, and McDonald (teller). Noes, 28—The Attorney-General, Treasurer, Commissioner of Public Works, Commissioner of Crown Lands, Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Blacker, Brooker, Castine, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Griffiths, Hooper, Houri- gan, Johnson, Kelly, McGillivray, MacLach- lan, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Price, Short, Solomon, Wood, and the Minister of Education (teller). Majority of 20 for the Noes. Pairs—Aye, Mr. Gilbert; No, Mr. Scherk. Preamble and title passed. The Bill was reported, and the standing orders having been suspended, the report was adopted. The MINISTER of EDUCATION moved the third reading. Sir JOHN DOWNER said this Bill gave to women the same right to sit in Parliament as men. He thought that it was simply meant to give the women the suffrage, but evidently something more than that was wanted. Un- doubtedly the Government had changed their views on this matter. Last year when he objected to the referendum the Government strongly supported it, but now they went against it. They had clearly changed their opinions on this and other matters connected with the Bill. He took a leading part in opposing the pro- posal with the referendum, as Mr. McPherson took a leading part in supporting it with it. (Mr. McPherson—""That was a year ago."") He was astonished at the change in the hon. member's views. He supposed if he were to propose the most democratic principle the hon. member and his party would oppose him. (Mr. Batchelor—"" Yes, if your object was to wreck another democratic measure."") Their move last year was to give women a vote after submitting it to the referendum, but his proposal was to give it without doing so. Was that trying to wreck a democratic measure? The referendum was introduced last year because the Hon. T. Playford would only sup- port the measure with the inclusion of that principle. He did not suppose that the demo- cratic party were earnest in their intentions with regard to female suffrage, but that they thought it was a good opportunity to intro- duce the referendum. (The Treasurer—""Now that you have the Bill as you want it what action will you take ?"") Did the Government suppose that he wanted to give woman a seat in Parliament ? The Government were not in earnest over the measure, or if they were they had sacrificed their platform pledges. (The Attorney -General —""They are in earnest.'') He had never anticipated that it would be a matter of not only giving women a vote but also a seat in the Parliament. He would consis- tently vote against the third reading, a pro- posal which he thought would really delight the Government Mr. CALDWELL said he would support the third reading, but hoped that the Legisla- tive Council would excise the amendment proposed by the Government to Mr. Hague's clause. Mr. GILES hardly understood how the Government could ask the House to agree to the Bill, seeing that they had given women a right to sit in the House. He would oppose the third reading. Mr. CASTINE altogether disagreed with the Minister of Education's amendment to Mr. Hague's clause, which would be greeted with ridicule throughout the country. He was, however, hopeful that the Legislative Council would strike it out, and under those circumstances he would not be one to wreck the Bill at this stage. Mr. LANDSEER said the vote just taken proved that the Government had been string- ing the House on. He was quite unprepared to see the Premier, who only a few years ago pooh-poohed the principle, support not only giving women a vote but also a seat in Parlia- ment. A nice state of things it would be when women had a seat in Parliament, and the action of the Premier proved to what extent some members were prepared to carry some of their peculiar freaks. Mr. SOLOMON thought if they were to grant the suffrage to women on the same lines as to men, it was a logical sequence to allow them the right to sit in Parliament. They heard much of the old gag about trusting the people, but the 32 members who were in favor of the Bill were afraid to remit the question to a plebiscite in spite of the fact that it was demanded by a large section of die community. It was little use to go over the whole subject again seeing that the majority at the back of the Govern- ment were prepared to swallow their convic- tions of a year ago. He regretted that the Council would not have a fair opportunity of considering the amendments that had been made, and Messrs. Caldwell and Castine knew that it was impossible for the Council to do so especially, as in the case of amendments a simple majority, and not a constitutional one, was necessary. He claimed that he was more sincere in his desire to refer grave matters of constitutional change to the people than the labor members, who had one opinion this year and another next. Few members believed that within a few years this measure would be before the House as s serious subject, or that it would be carried by a Government who were domi- nated by an ultra democratic party. He regretted for the credit of the colony that such a measure had been passed, as it would delay federation by at least 20 years. In some colonies they had plural voting, and in this one-man one-vote, but by this Bill they placed another barrier to a uniform system of electing the representatives of the various colonies which would still further delay federation about which they had heard the Attorney- General and the Treasurer speak so earnestly. Mr. GRAINGER said the carrying of the Bill meant farewell to federation, as the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria were not such idiots as to adopt female suffrage. It was not likely that two colonies with such pluck and energy as these would join an emasculated colony like South Australia. He had chiefly risen for the purpose of quoting the platform utterances of the Attorney-General, who at the last elec- tions said:—""Female suffrage—He was not prepared to vote for it (Hear, hear.) When he was he would go to the logical conclusion of giving women a seat in the House. Scientifi- cally there was a good deal to be said for female suffrage, but he was not satisfied that a majority of the women in South Australia de- sired it. He favored the referendum on many questions, and if by a referendum the women of South Australia by a fair majority declare their wish for the franchise he would alter his attitude. He knew many ladies shared his opinion that they should pause before embarking on the troublous seas of political life. He objected to an active minority forcing on the majority a participation in politics. Let the ladies convert their own sex first. He did not favor shortening the term of service in the Upper House; rather reduce the qualification and assimilate the suffrage to that of the House of Assembly."" When the Premier was so distinctly pledged he should resign rather than not fulfil his pledges. The members of the Ministry reminded him in their action of the American Shakers. On the motion of Mr. BROOKER the de- bate was adjourned till the same day. LOAN BILL. This Bill was introduced by the TREA- SURER and read a first time, the second reading being fixed for the same day. RAILWAYS COMMISSIONERS ACT AMENDMENT BILL. Adjourned debate on second reading. Mr. GRAINGER said he would not vote for this Bill without further information. It had been said that Mr. Hill would receive the position at £1,200 a year. He wanted to know what power the board of advice was to have. Would the Traffic Manager and the Engineer- in-Chief have a voting power? Who was to be appointed? (The Attorney-General— "" It is not decided."") Well, that was gross cruelty, and showed gross incompetency on the part of the Government. The Attorney-General made cruel and unjust remarks about the Chair- man of Railway Commissioners at the close of the last Parliament. The statement that the Ministry had not made up their minds was an excuse for not telling Parliament what they were going to do. It was a very base subterfuge. He hoped hon. members would not vote for the Bill until they got those facts out of the Govern- ment. Would the board of advice have the power to outvote the Commissioner? (The Commissioner of Public Works—"" They have a consultative voting power."") Clause 2 said —"" That from June, 1895, there shall be one Commissioner, who shall be a body corporate, and the principal Act shall be read as if the same had provided for the appointment and incor- poration of one Commissioner."" Clause 3 stated —"" A board of advice for the assistance of the Commissioner is hereby constituted, consisting of theEngineer- in-Chief, the General Traffic Manager, and the Locomotive Engineer. Meetings of such board shall be convened by and presided over by the Commissioner, and shall be held not less than once a month; and minutes of the proceedings of such board shall be forwarded every month to the Minister."" The former Bill gave a power of appeal to the Commissioner of Public Works if the two junior Commissioners did not agree with the Chairman of Commissioners, but clause 2 would give all the power to one man. The chairman must be under political control, and if so what was the use of paying him £1,200 a year? Why not go on as they did in the past? The Railway Commissioners were very nice fellows, but there was not one that he would like to see made into the creature of a Commis- sioner of Public Works or the tool of a Parlia- ment. The Bill would lead to disorganisation in the service, and to the railways being poli- tically managed. The Commissioner at £1,200 would simply be there to take the blame of the Ministry of the day. He opposed the Bill. Mr. BATCHELOR would support the Bill, although he was not strongly in favor of the system of controlling the railways by means of Commissioners. In New Zealand the Rail- way Commissioners had been abolished altogether, and in Queensland it was pro- posed to have only one Commissioner. In Victoria the old board had resigned. We should be in the fashion if we followed the practice of the other colonies. When our Railway Commissioners were appointed there was considerable disaffection among the heads of the departments. These heads of depart- ments overlapped a good deal, and the various Ministers who controlled the department were only in office for a short time, to that they could not get a complete grasp of the situation. It was thought well at the outset to remove the Commissioners from political influence, and it was considered that by doing this better results would be gained. The system adopted during the last six years as to the control of the departmental officers had worked well. Mr. BATCHELOR received leave to con- tinue his remarks on the same day. LAKE BONNEY IRRIGATION BILL. Consideration of the amendments of the Legislative Council. The COMMISSIONER of PUBLIC WORKS moved the adoption of amendments Nos. 1 to 7, which he explained provide that any paying settler may take up two blocks of land. Mr. BATCHELOR objected to this. No settler should have more than one block. Mr. BROOKER thought that it would be well to agree to the amendment. A settler might take up two blocks so as to provide one for his son. The amendments were adopted. Amendment No. 7. In folio 13 insert new clause 70A to follow clause 70:—70 A. ""Poll to be taken. —No license or permit of any kind for the sale of intoxicating liquor shall be granted within the settlement until a poll has been taken under the provisions of Part IV. of 'The Licensed Victuallers Amendment Act of 1891.' "" Agreed to. The amendments were reported, and the report was adopted. ADJOURNMENT. The House at 12.59 a.m. adjourned till the same day at 10.30 a.m."

THE SURVEYOR-GENERAL'S REPORT.",Article,"Border Watch (Mount Gambier, SA : 1861 - 1954)",19-12-1894,Article,4589,"The Border Watch. PUBLISHED EVERY WEDNESDAY AND SATUR- DAY MORNING. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1894. THE SURVEYOR-GENERAL'S REPORT. Some interesting information is afforded by the report of the Surveyor general (Mr. W. Strawbridge) for the year 1893-4, a few items of which we give below. The field staff consists of the Deputy Surveyor-General and 20 sur- veyors, and during the year they surveyed 1,654,930 acres, the largest area surveyed in any one year except 1887-8. The average cost of surveying was 2d. per acre, the total cost being £13,474 10s. 6d. Besides the surveyors there are connected with the department 32 draughtsmen, 22 clerks, and 19 em- ployes in the photo-lithographic office. Total, 94. It is said many thousands of rabbits have been destroyed in the more arid districts by the drought, but in other districts they are very numerous, and will, unless decisive measures are taken for their destruction, rapidly increase. This information can scarcely be said to be new. During the year £3,480 16s. 7d. was advanced to district councils, &c., for vermin-proof fencing. The total sum advanced for that purpose to June 30 was £26,355 8s. 5d., of which £6,970 1s. 7d. was repaid, leaving £19,385 7s 8d, owing. Wild dogs are reported very num- erous north of Border Town and in several other localities. During the year 42,328 dog and 19 fox scalps were paid for by the department out of the funds collected by a rate of 6d. per per mile on leased pastoral country ; total amount, £15,374 7s. 9d. It is very evident the wild dogs are being cleared off the country. The dingo will soon be as extinct as the Diprotodon. The five land boards have been busy. In the course of the year they dealt with 3,701 applications, and allotted 698,148 acres to 1,161 allottees. Those figures include 6,183 acres allotted as homestead blocks to 478 persons. The South - Eastern Land Board dealt with 655 applica- tions, and allotted 132,737 acres to 111 applicants. Of the total area, 132,584 acres, were ordinary lands which were allotted to 96 persons, giving each an average area of 1,381 acres. They allotted 153 acres for homestead blocks to 15 applicants. The South- Eastern Board travelled 3,195 miles, and inspected 477,256 acres. The total expenses of the five boards for the year were £8,734 6s. 8d. One hundred and seventy five allot- ments were cancelled for non-payment of the first year's rent, and in this con- nection the Surveyor-General says that as the Act does not provide for the payment of any deposit where the sum is under £1 applicants frequently apply for the land without any inten- tion of keeping it. An alteration is recommended. The Surveyor- General advocates what the most advanced party in the Legislature and the colony have long sought —some means of preventing homestead blockers disposing of their land as soon as they complete the purchase. He fears that without some provision that the land shall be retained as homestead blocks the object of settling the people per- manently on the land (excepting within a radius of ten miles of the G-.P.O., where blocks are only let on perpetual lease) will be defeated. During the year 804 homestead blocks, containing 9,232 acres, were let for a yearly rental of £964 10s. 7d. Loans were made to blockers during the year to the amount of £3,844. Five hundred and sixty-four acres were purchased for homesteads during 1893-4 for £711 5s. Of that 453¼ acres were leased at a yearly rental of £29 17s. 3d. Up to June 30 last 2,835 acres were purchased for home- steads for £11,590 6s. 6d., and the whole except 733 acres have been leased at a yearly rental of £505 5s. 3d. Twelve village settlements have been established. They contain 66,363 acres, and the number of villagers are 533. Ten of the settle- ments, containing 63,537 acres, are on the River Murray. The largest in population is Pyap, which the com- mittee at Mount Gambier was formed to assist. It contains 90 settlers. The area applied for is 10,530 acres. The report comments — "" The suc- cess or otherwise of these settlements will depend upon the settlers them- selves. They have been started in a favorable season, and though some of them were late in commencing operations, the results are fairly satis- factory. The total population is about 1,750, and, collectively, they have 77 acres of garden and orchard, 195 acres under wheat crops, cleared about 900 acres of scrub,"" and effected many other improvements. The liability of the State for im- provements on pastoral leases is estimated at present at £1,484,330, which may be reduced by surrenders with the view of taking up new leases under the Act of 1893. In 1893-4 the amount paid for improvements was £19,361 0s. 11d., making the total paid to lessees for improvements £731,556 17s. 1d. There are now open for application 3,427 square miles of pastoral country at rentals fixed by the Pastoral Board, and 8,530 square miles of vermin in- fested country at a pepper-corn rental for the first five years, 1s. per mile for the second five years, and 2s. 6d. per mile for the remainder of the term. The area held in fee simple in the colony is 7,113,170 acres; 748,625 acres are still held on credit agree- ments; 99,275,347 acres are held on leases of various kinds, chiefly pastoral; 2,027,053 acres have been granted for various objects or have been reserved for roads, etc., and 134,070,605 acres remain in the hands of the Crown. The total amount of arrears in rents on all classes of leases is £25,738, which is very much less than the public have been led to suppose. It is a small amount when it is remembered that the annual rental reaches the large sum of £180,070. Two splendid detailed plans accom- pany the report, showing how all the land is held south of 26deg. south latitude. Military NOTES.—This afternoon a return match between the Mount Gambier Volunteer Company (foot) and the team of civilians who recently fired a match with them will be brought off on the Brewery Paddock range. Distances 200, 500, and 600 yds.; seven rounds per man at each distance. Lieut. Marshall and Privs. Aconley and Underwood will be able to shoot to-day, but Capt. Howland, Priv. Brown, and some other good shots who fired in the first match, will be unavoidably absent. The match between the Civilians and the Mounted Rifles will not be fired to-day, the Mounted Riflemen being unable to bring their best team forward. It will probably be fixed for some day in January. CANTATA BY CHILDREN.—This evening the children forming the Mount Gambier Loyal Temperance Legion will sing T. Henry Muxlow's pretty and pathetic cantata ""Alone in London,"" in the Institute Hall. The story, as we have already mentioned, illustrates child life in the lower walks of society in London and is in this respect full of material to call forth feelings of sympathy and pity, and these are in a measure lightened by the other side of the story, which shows the efforts made by charitable people and organisations to help them. The connective readings give the whole story, and the choruses, which are well chosen, alike for melodiousness as for subject, will ad- mirably and pleasantly illustrate the tale. About 100 children have been under training by Mr. S. E. Higgs for the cantata for some time, and will doubtless give a good account of themselves. Their conduct at the rehearsals promises that. In the course of the evening a beautiful tableau, ""The White Ribbon,"" in which 50 or 60 young girls will take part will be shown. This will be a highly spectacular part of the programme, and will be exceedingly interesting. As the admission to the cantata will be sixpence only, there will doubtless be a crowded attendance. Y UNION SOCIAL.—On Friday evening a successful social in connection with the Y Union of Mount Gambier was held in the Rechabites' Hall. Although the weather was threatening there was a fair attendance. The Rev. J. Paynter presided. Short addresses were given in the course of the evening by the Chairman, Mrs. Bethune, and Miss MacKay ; songs by Mrs. Higgs, Mrs. Kieselbach, Mrs. Holtje, and Mr. W. R. Walter; and recita- tions by Miss Walsh, Misses Greenlees and Pickett, and Mr. Niquet. Towards the end of the proceedings refreshments were served out to all present. A very enjoyable re-union closed at nearly half-past ten o'clock, Kalangadoo.—The Wesleyan Church anni- versary was held in the school-room on Sunday last. The Rev. W. A. Gann preached in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Selected hymns were sung very sweetly by the children at each service, and Mrs. A. S. Kentish and Mr D. T. Ellison deserve very great for the training of them. A picnic in connection with the Sunday-school will be held on Christmas Day, and a concert in connection with the day school on the 20th inst. The proceeds of the latter will go to provide prizes for the children. BEACHPORT COUNCIL. — A quorum of the Beachport Council did not assemble on Wednesday last, and the meeting lapsed. A special meeting has been called for to-day. AUCTIONS.—Messrs. Goymour and Co. will sell at the residence, adjacent to the Ladies College in Elizabeth-street to-day, the household furniture and effects of Miss Ayliffe, who has disposed of her school. Mr. L. DeGaris will to-day offer a quantity of land under instruc- tions from Mr. Jacob Chambers. To-morrow, at Millicent, Mr. DeGaris will offer for sale Mr. F. W. Schultz's interest in a number of leases, and some land belonging to Mr. Jacob Chambers. The CHIEF JUSTICE of Victoria speaking at a school breaking up in Melbourne a few days ago remarked on the lack of sentiment mani- fested in Young Australia, He said:—"" This nation—or rather the makings of a nation— needed the adornments of poetry more than any other nation, for we were sprung from pro- genitors who were eminently practical them- selves, and who had transmitted this quality to their descendants. Poetry which repre- presented all that was brightest, purest, and best in human character was sadly lacking in this community, as one could not but see and lament, whether on the platform or in the council chamber or the law court. Our young men took their standard of humour and their literary models from a certain class of American writers, especially from Mark Twain and Bret Harts, and instead of addressing themselves to the elevating aspect of their subjects they generally aimed at merely working in some little point of humour of the Yankee type, expressed in language which was wholly of the Yankee class. It was said that we were a democracy here; that we had no need for the fripperies and adornments of speech; and that all that a plain man needed was the ability to say what he meant in a plain way. That, however, was exactly what the plain man never did, and instead of saying what he meant he generally dropped down into commonplace, which was bald if not unintelligible. The lover sighing like a furnace and writing odes to his lady's eyebrow was hardly to be found in Australia, and, indeed, there seemed to be a marked degeneracy in this direction, for the average young man between the ages of 18 and 21 would as soon be detected in pick- ing a pocket as in writing a sonnet to his mistress's eyebrow, or even to the whole accu- mulated volume of her charms. This was a great defect, and the lover himself was immensely the loser by doing without the sus- tenance which poetry could give, and which he knew from his own experience that it did give in that direction. If lovers would only admit to themselves the value of poetry in raising their ideals they would find a divine spark in the human clay, and no one would ever again put forward for serious discussion such a ques- tion as ' Is marriage a failure ?' It might be a little out of place on an occasion like that to venture upon such a subject, but he was quite sure that the time was close at hand when it would not be out of place."" SALVATION ARMY. —The meetings of the Salvation Army at Mount Gambier on Sunday were led by Adjutant Rackham, of Melbourne. The adjutant is a Mount Gambier lad, who has advanced rapidly in the ranks of the Army, and there were large meetings to see and hear him. On Monday he went to Millicent. Captain Gear, who came down from the city on Friday evening, spent Sunday at Millicent, and with Captain Witney, of Millicent, con- ducted a musical meeting at Mount Gambier on Monday evening. Captain Gear, it may be added, came to Mount Gambier on behalf of the Rescue work, and to push forward the distribution of the Grace Before Meat boxes. Every one who takes one of these boxes pro- mises to contribute one penny per week for the social work of the Army, and to try to induce others to do so. These boxes are to be de- livered to the Captain of the corps every quarter. No information has yet been received here as to who will assist Mrs. Fox during the Captain's absence. THE WOMAN SUFFRAGE BILL PASSED.—The House of Assembly began sitting this week on Monday afternoon, and at 1 o'clock yesterday morning adjourned to half-past 10 the same morning. The subject of consideration was the Adult Suffrage Bill, which confers the Legis- lative franchise on women. Every clause of the measure while it was being considered in Committee was stone-walled by the minority, who are adverse to woman suffrage. But at half-past 11 o'clock yesterday morning the Bill was got through Committee, read a third time, and passed. The measure, as it passed the Legislative Council (where it was intro- duced) at the end of August last, contained four clauses. The first one extended to women the right to vote for persons to sit in Parlia- ment as members of the Legislative Council, and the right to vote for persons to sit in Parliament as members of the House of Assembly. The second was worded—"" Women shall possess and may exercise the rights hereby granted, subject to the same qualifica- tions and in the same manner as men."" The third clause amended all Constitution and Electoral Acts so far as was nec- cessary to give effect to the Act, and the fourth gave it a short title. In the House of Assembly on Monday night the Bill was amended by inserting a provision allowing women who may live three miles from a polling booth or may be near their confinement to take advantage of the Absent Voters Act, and it will have, of course, to be sent back to the Legislative Council for the consideration of those amend- ments. We believe South Australia is the second place in the British Empire to adopt woman suffrage, New Zealand having led the way. CAKE FAIR.—A cake fair in aid of St. Paul's Church school is to be held on Saturday next in the Institute Hall. See advertisement. THE VICTORIAN MAILS.—Under the new arrangement whereby the Melbourne mails will reach Casterton at 8 p.m. the mails from Victoria for Mount Gambier will be detained there until the following morning, and will arrive here at 3 p.m. Thus the latest Mel- bourne mails will be 33 hours old. It will quite destroy the value of the Melbourne even- ing papers, as the news they contain will be received by way of Adelaide 17 hours before they arrive. The new arrangement will be very inconvenient to South - Eastern men of business having communications with Vic- toria. WE have received from the Eureka Ad- vertising Agency of Binghampton, New York, a copy of their "" Eureka Newspaper Guide,"" 1894 edition. This deals with the Press of the United States, Canada, and Aus- tralasia, and the information it supplies is clearly and methodically classified, and readily got at. Information is also supplied as to the individual states of America, their population, principal products, political parties, etc. ACCIDENT.—On Saturday afternoon Alex- ander Saunders, aged about 9 years, son of Mr. Inspector Saunders, had the misfortune to chop the top of his right thumb off with a tomahawk, which he was using to chop a piece of rope. Dr. Johnson was called, and replaced the thumb top, and no bad results are likely to occur. CRICKET NOTES —The Mount Gambier Club will play a combined team from the Gambier East, Allandale, Compton, and Nelson Clubs to-day on the Oval. Play will start at 11 a.m. The combined team as chosen have been already published in the Watch. The follow- ing have been chosen to play for the Mount Gambier Club:—W. R. Walter (Captain), R. J. Sexton, H. Lawrence, W. R. Jones. A. J. Grieve, J. MacDonald, O. J. Foote, D. Mac- Kenzie, M. Millington, J. M. Currie, and R. Besley. The grass on the Oval has been partly cut, and the clearness of the ground will aid the scoring. PRESENTATION.—On Saturday evening, at a special meeting of the Mount Gambier Hunt Club, convened for the purpose, Mr. Henry Lane, of the National Bank, was presented with a valuable walking stick, in acknowledgment of his services towards the Club at the last race meeting. Mr. Lane collected a large amount of money towards the meeting, he was one of the promoters of the cake fair, and was of service in other respects. The walking stick is of ebony, topped with ivory, and silver mounted, and is inscribed ""To Mr. H. Lane, from the Mount Gambier Hunt Club, 1894."" Mr. J. Shepherd made the presentation on behalf of the Club. REFERRING to the disorganization and lack of patriotic feeling which prevails in the Assembly, and the long night sittings which took place last week, the Register thus writes: —"" The taxpayers will have to toil and slave to raise money for repayment of principal and interest in connection with this proposed new loan; yet while the authorising resolutions were being passed several members worn out by sheer fatigue, slumbered in blissful oblivion to what was being done. These had to be aroused so that they might vote in divisions upon proposals which they had not heard discussed, and in one instance at least a representative of the people could not be summoned from dreamland quickly enough to enable him to cross over to his party's side. And this is termed legislating— lawmaking. At another stage of the proceed- ings only one Minister was awake, and it was unreasonable to expect him to be as competent to explain the business before the House as he was twelve or thirteen hours before, when the weary process of fagging-out began. Nor could proper attention to any explanation be fairly required from the few insomnia-troubled members who listened or tried to listen to it. In fact, such day and night sittings cannot be too strongly condemned. The proceedings marking them degenerate into mere legislative farces without a mirth-producing quality. It is impossible for the public to feel much respect for or confidence in Parliament while such things continue, and the sooner this fact is taken to heart the better for our Parliamentary institutions. So far as Saturday morn- ing's transactions are concerned, it is hardly more surprising than gratifying that the Assembly succeeded in reducing the loan schedule to the extent of £200,000. This alteration shows that the criticism directed against the peculiar proposals of the Govern- ment was not altogether useless. But the circumstances in which it was made lead also to another conclusion. If the details of the schedule—a schedule composed of curious shreds and patches—had been considered in a wakeful House they might have been amended with still more advantage to the taxpayer. For the taxpayer comes distinctly into the question. It is he who has to bear the brunt of Parliamentary blunders, whether they be committed while legislators are conscious or while they are only in a somnambulistic condition."" MR. GEORGE ASH, M.P.—A new firm of barristers and solicitors has been created under the style of Kingston & Ash, Mr. George Ash, M.P. for Albert, who was admitted as a prac- titioner of the Supreme Court on Saturday morning, having entered into partnership with the Hon. C. C. Kingston, Q.C., MP. (the Attorney-General), with whom he served his articles. At the end of his first Parliamentary session in 1891 Mr. Ash decided to adopt the law as his profession. He passed the necessary matriculation examination at the Adelaide University in March, 1891, and since then has completed the four years' course for the L.L.B. degree, being the first student to obtain that degree under the new regulations. His career at the University has been most brilliant, and in entering into business on the day of his ad- mission to the Bar he probably beats the record in this colony. Directly he was admitted to practise Mr. Arthur Hardy, one of the oldest lawyers in Adelaide, tendered Mr. Ash his first brief, which the new lawyer accepted. Mr. Hardy at one time represented Albert in the Assembly, and was defeated by Mr. Ash. This unusual compliment paid to the member for Albert was therefore a graceful act on the part of the ex-politician. Mr. Ash is thirty- five years of age. Soon after he came to the colony—about fifteen years ago—he joined the staff of the Border Watch at Mount Gambier, and shortly afterwards went to the Narracoorte Herald, which was then owned by the pro- prietors of the Border Watch, and which was purchased later by Mr. Ash and his partner, Mr. J. B. Mather. Messrs. Mather and Ash conducted the Herald until the famous libel action which was brought against the paper, and soon afterwards Mr. Ash entered Parliament. —Register. MR. HENRY VARLEY, the well-known evange- list, is paying another visit to the colonies. He arrived in Adelaide per the Himalaya last Saturday. Dr. Mayo, a well-known and popular Adelaide doctor, died on Sunday morning. He had attained to the good old age of 88. THERE is a split in the Victorian Cabinet over the taxation programme, and Sir Fred. Sargood, Minister of Defence, has marked his disapproval of it by retiring. Miss SPENCE has returned to Adelaide from her journeyings through America and Great Britain, where she unfolded her scheme for proportionate representation, and spoke fre- quently on behalf of women's rights. It was arranged that she should have a ""welcome"" on Monday night. This took place in the Cafe de Paris, and was very hearty. A resolution was passed urging members of Parliament to support the third reading of the Women's Suffrage Bill. THERE is joy at Coolgardie. Over an inch of rain fell there on Friday and Saturday last, and all the dams have caught a more or less welcome stock of water. Several of the Gov- ernment dams have from five to nine feet of water in them. This is the best rain that has fallen since the goldfield was opened up. Many of the diggers are away or leaving for a holiday, but the rain has brightened the pros- pects wonderfully. Fever is prevalent on the fields, but it is hoped the rain will diminish it. THE weather faired on Saturday, and since then has been pleasantly fine, but yester- day afternoon another turn of inclement weather was threatening. The rains of last week, amounting at Mount Gambier to 2 305 inches, have done a vast amount of good to the crops and gardens and the grass, the extent of which every day continues to reveal. The potatoes have especially benefited by the splendid rain, and the grass will be kept green some weeks longer by its means. HORSES FOR ADELAIDE.—By train on Mon- day morning three vans of horses, containing 22 head, were sent from Mount Gambier by Mr. W. G. Pannell to a firm of salesmen in Adelaide. LOCAL COURT.—The Mount Gambier Local Court will sit to-morrow (Thursday). The cause list contains two unsatisfied judgments, and four defended causes. The latter are— Elizabeth Carrison v. Jas. Hunter, £6: Thos. Williams v. John Shanahan, £10 5s.; G Sturtzel v. W. J. Deasley, £9 1s. 3d.; and A. Kieselbach v. — Gollan, £4 10s. HOLIDAY TRAIN ARRANGEMENTS. — The Mayor (Mr. J. T. Morris, J.P.) wrote to the Traffic Superintendent of South-Eastern Rail- ways (Mr. J. Henderson) on Friday last, sug- gesting that daily trains might be run on the Mount Gambier and Beachport and Narra- coorte and Kingston lines during Christmas and New Year weeks. On Saturday Mr. Henderson replied as follows: — ""Traffic Superintendent's Office, Narracoorte Station, 15th December, 1894. Sir,—Your favor of the 14th inst. I am much obliged for your sugges- tions in connection with the train service during the approaching holidays, but would respectfully point out that the matter has already engaged the attention of the depart- ment, and arrangements have been decided upon which will doubtless fully tax our carriage accommodation, but at the same time answer all necessary requirements. The Beachport regatta on the 26th of December will form an attraction which will offer a very favourable opportunity to visitors to Mount Gambier to have a run to the seaside, but it is very problematical—even presuming the running could now be conveniently arranged— so far as past experiences can be taken, that the working of the Beachport train on the other days suggested would encourage a traffic at all commensurate with the expense of running it. On the 28th December the department will run a special excursion train from Narracoorte to Kingston and return, and on the 1st January a special train will run from Millicent to Mount Gambier in connection with the Caledonian sports. The department also propose running an excursion train from Kingston to Narra- coorte and return on the 1st January in con- nection with the Narracoorte athletic sports. I hope these arrangements will be considered satisfactory. Again thanking you, yours faithfully, J. HENDERSON, Traffic Superin- tendent. To James T. Morris, Esq., Mayor, Mount Gambier."" IN these days it is more than difficult to devise new methods of extracting money from the public for charitable or any other purposes. It has remained, however, for the ladies of Adelaide who are working in connection with the Village Settlements' Aid Society to apply a method new to this city, although fairly well tested in others. Following the example of cities in which ""Hospital Saturday "" is recog- nised as a permanent institution, the ladies here determined to organise a public collec- tion in the principal thoroughfares on Saturday last. Citizens were thoroughly warned of this attempt upon their pockets by public advertisement; it did not come upon them, therefore, with a great shock when they found fifteen of the principal positions in the thoroughfares taken possession of by two or three ladies at a time, from midday until 6 in the evening, and in some cases until 9.30, in- tent upon getting all the money that they could from passers-by. In addition to these stations in town there was also one at Glenelg, and the total result of the self-denying efforts of the ladies is the—in these times—fairly satisfactory sum of rather more than £60. When the funds that are expected from all sources are received it is hoped to make a very substantial Christmas gift to all the settlements.— Advertiser."

THE COUNCIL AT WORK AGAIN.",Article,"The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889 - 1931)",19-12-1894,Article,1369,"The Advertiser WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 19. 1894. THE COUNCIL AT WORK AGAIN. YESTERDAY the most interesting business of Parliament was transacted in the Legislative Council. Apparently the strike had been declared ""off,"" though no public intimation was given of a satis- factory settlement of the trumpery dis- pute between the two Houses which had led to it. As the Chief Secretary was unable to secure the statutory majority necessary to replae the Electoral Bill on the notice paper, from which it had fallen owing to the adjournment last week, it appears that this measure will have to be aban- doned for the session. In any case, there would hardly have been sufficient time for the Assembly properly to consider its provisions. The Bill is, however, one of so useful a character, speaking generally, that its fate is to be regretted. An attempt was made by Mr. Ward to shelve the Licensed Victuallers Bill, but it failed. Is this item kept on the programme merely to provide material for talk. Any other explanation can scarcely be imagined, since there is not the least chance that so contentious a measure can be carried during the last days of the session. The Factories Bill has reached the stage when, to save it, either the Assembly must give way in its opposition to Council amendments, or differences must be adjusted by a conference. The Council in- sists on all its alterations of the Bill to which the other branch has disagreed. The Assembly declares that the aggregate overtime beyond 48 hours a week for a woman or young person employed in a factory shall not exceed 50 hours in the year ; the Council is firm in asking that the limit be increased to 100 hours. Hon. gentlemen are still unconvinced of the necessity of the clause prohibiting the employment of a woman in a factory within four weeks after childbirth. Nor will the Council relinquish its addition to clause 17, providing that a child under the age of 13 may be employed in a factory if he or she has passed the compulsory educa- tional standard and the inspector approves. We have always advocated this sensible exception to the prohibition of child-labor. Surely if a boy is withdrawn from school on reaching the compulsory standard before he is 13 years old it is far better that his parents should be able to put him to work in a properly regulated and inspected factory than that, very likely, he should have the run of the streets. A factory is defined by the Bill as a manu- factory, workshop, or workroom, in which six or more persons are employed. Clause 25, however, reduced the minimum of employes to four in the special case of factories where apparel is manufactured. The Assembly pleads for its retention on the ground that insanitary conditions most frequently exist in connection with such places; but the Council refuses to withdraw its objection to the clause. After much fighting in both Houses, the Women's Suffrage Bill has finally been passed, and now only awaits the Queen's assent to become part of the law of the South Australian constitution. The Assembly returned the Bill to the Council with a new clause extending the benefit of the Absent Voters Act to female electors who make a declaration that they reside more than three miles from the nearest polling-place, or that by reason of the state of their health they will prob- ably be unable to vote at the polling-place on election day. This clause is open to two objections. First, it conflicts with the claim of the absolute political equality of the two sexes by granting to women, solely on account of their sex, a special electoral concession. Secondly, it is dangerous in itself, since the application of the Absent Voters Act cannot be broadened as proposed without a grave risk of further injury to the sys- tem of vote by ballot. On one or other, or both, of these grounds many advocates of female enfranchisement would prefer the Bill without the new clause inserted by the Assembly. A similar, though not quite identical, clause was proposed by opponents of the measure while it was going through committee in the Council, but rejected. Yesterday, however, the friends of the Bill agreed to the provision, positively refusing to suc- cumb to the artful persuasions of members on the other side who invited them to amend the clause and make it still more liberal to women. This apparently chivalrous plea on behalf of female electors was disregarded owing to a natural dread of possible con- sequences. Dr. Magarey confessed, with perfect candor, that if the fate of the Bill did not depend on it, he would have pre- ferred rejecting the new clause, and leaving over till next session the whole question of voting through the post. But he was by no means willing to sacrifice the principle of women's suffrage on a mere question of machinery. The opponents of the Bill pleaded in vain. They affirmed that as they were beaten on the policy of the Bill their only desire was to improve it. And this was true ; they would have been quite satisfied to improve the Bill out of existence altogether. We have never been friendly to women's suffrage, though recognising its inevitableness and hoping for the best. We have put the case against it temperately and, we believe, not unfairly. But we have no sympathy with the tactics of many of its Parliamen- tary opponents. Some of them have dis- played a remarkable readiness to over come their objections to women's suffrage provided only that the party advantage of increased property representation were gained by confining the franchise to women with a property qualification. Many have resorted to almost every conceivable trick and subterfuge in order to defeat the Bill. Opposi- tion of this kind does not pay in the long run. Insincerity and inconsistency are speedily detected, and there is no other result than injury to the cause in which unworthy weapons are employed. The Taxation Bill is saved, but not without the aid of a little diplomacy on the part of the Government. Of the half-dozen suggestions of the Council to which the Assembly disagreed the one of greatest importance was the proposal for a tax on mortgagees. It was stated by the Chief Secretary that the Government recognised a good deal of force in the argument for dividing the liability for land tax in respect of encumbered land between themortgagor and the mortgagee. During the recess Ministers would care fully consider the question, with a view to the introduction of a short Bill. Mr. O'Loghlin, who introduced the sug- gested new clause providing for taxation of the mortgagee, felt that it was useless for him to press the point. The only result of insisting on the suggestion would be to wreck the Bill. But that would not improve the position as regards mortgaged lands. ""I shall not assist the mortgagor, ""said Mr. O'Loghlin, "" but I shall lose the Bill"" As a supporter of the measure, therefore, his coarse was plain, and a majority of the Council, accepting the same view of the situation, went with him. The Council resolved not to insist on any of its suggestions. One of them at least—that applying the absentee tax only to persons owning land in South Australia who live outside the Australasian colonies—was deserving of more favorable consideration from the Assembly than it received. But the majority in the Council had to face the alternative of giving way, or of destroying a measure the general policy of which they approve. The procedure under the compact does not appear to be quite satisfactory. In a case like this, where the Assembly agrees to certain murgeettons and disagrees to the rest, the Council must resolve either to insist or not insist. If it insists, the Bill is rejected. There is no provision for securing further consideration or arranging any com promise. The proposal that the two Houses should confer with a view to an improvement of the machinery for the working of the compact is one that deserves early attention."

The Treasurer Delt ln-ived the ijucond read ing ?f ti:e Ixjan lii.il, ixi-upWup six miuuUs iu the pn?>t>B. Mr. (ii^inper couipiained that he had not had time to read the Bill and he tried to f oroe au adjournment, lieing bea t<-u, however, by SI volts ti> 1-. Compelled iy cpeak Mr. Gramgi-r (uudemm.-d ineuibers who talked for huurs aljout the iv-duetion of a j)onny in the salary of a Civil servant, for their headlong haste in rushing the hmu of £1,1)00,000 du-ough. He iiCu^tsul the Government aud their sup ]?>rterb of jiaviiiij done must of tiiu stonewalling during the .ti-.uu, aud he stated that if the Treasurer thur->ut""hly uuderetood the require ments ot the [Ki.sit;iou he would set the nnanecs of the oniony iu ordur and consolidate the public debt. Hi- also atks for a proper Bill to deal Aitli the Saviuj? Bank and protests against the tvrrog-adu movement in substituting bonds for stock under the new loan, which he thinks should be floated at 3 pur cant At 1 o'clockj juot as Mr. Grainger was aticnou fedgmg ins loss of faith iu sinking funds, the Tii-:it,ui'er moved tho suspensiou of the sitting for an hour, aiid there was a rush to lunch. Ou resuming Mr. Grainger informed his fellows that Great Britain is. gradually making a conquest of the world by' the power of her purse, aud he admitted that in all probability she or.-ns three-quarters of South America. With a strung denunciation of tho financiers who are endeavoring to injure the credit of the Savings Bank Mr. Grainger eat down. Mr. Giles at 2.20 took up the tale with c protest agunst further borrowing, especially to pay for [lastorul impniveiumts, the Ucetaloo reoer voir, or the St. Kilda embunlmientis. Par liament, he says, in the. past lias been as muuii to blame iu respect to the floating of loans as any Government. Mr. Butler ex cused the floating of a loan as the money is needed to pay the debts contracted bv previous Treasurers. He does not think, iwrever, that more than £SQQ.tXW is needed. Mr. Homburg praised Mr. Grainger's speech, and said that whether the alternative issue of bonds or inscribed stock was a success or a failure it would bo a fluke. Ho objects to jHiuring more money into that ""shocking pink"" Port Pirie, and lie says the members for Gladstone always go into opposition whenever money is not spent in their district. Would it not be better, he asked, to let Port Pirie silt up and Ui go to Port Germein instead ? A tram line or a rai]iray could be constructed to Port Pirie, or iiie ljarges could be dragged there through the mud, he said. Ue praised Port Augusta as the beat harbor on the coast. "" Have you ever seen Port Broughton? asked Mr. Gillen, and the cruel reply was that this place would soon be wiped off the map. Mr. Hague complained of the haste with which the resolutions preiiminarv to the Loan Bill had been burned tlirougb. Mr. CaldweU affirmed that lie has never seen more men out of work either in city or country than are unemployed at present. There is want of confidence now cm the part of tbe private investor, he says, and that feeling will soon extend to the public bonds. Salaries are bound to come down, he thinks, but he would rather see everyone work ing for a living wage than a few receiving high salaries and others idle. Sir. Moule pointed out certain discrepancies in the published figures relating to the loan fund, and the Trea surer testily interjected—""The charges arise cut of your ignorance."" Mr. Moule objects that there is not a day's employment in the Government Bills, and he is certain that women are more anxious that their husbands and sonsshould get work than that the franchise should be extended. Mr. Gilbert condemned the piecemeal public works policy of the province hitherto, and advises more system in tbe future. He believes ii> keeping Treasurers f hort of funds. Mr. Ash Baid tbe schedule of the Bill was bo curtailed as to be misleading to English lenders. The Government in this matter, he said, were dishonest through care lessness. Mr. Londseer says cheerily that all young communities have to borrow heavily and all must go through timee of depression. He remembers many such periods, be says. Mr. Kiddocb having given his views, Mr. Catt loyally defended the expenditure at Port Pirie, and affirmed that no other public money bad been so beneficially laid out. Messrs. Kelly, Brooker, Howe (who also epoke up for Port Pirie), and C&stine carried tbe talk to the dinner adjournment. V.ry few members came promptly from refreshment to labor bo that Major Castine had to call attention to the etate of tbe House before a quorum could be made up. The Council by message sent down the Friendly Societies Bill, the fieooad reading of which was fixed for to-day, as was the consideration of the Council amendments in the Factories BilL The Upper House also notified tlie appoint ment of a committee to confer as to better accommodation for the members of that Chamber. The Treasurer cot his chance to reply at 7.40 p.m., and he explained that the maximum rate fixed for the loan was 34 per cent, ao as to allow of the adoption uf Mr. Grainger to float S par cent, bonds if tbe market is favorable. The right to redeem stock early, Sir. Holder sava, will have the effect of raising die price, while he thinks it wise to euit the desire of customers by celling inscribed stock in London and bonds in Adelaide. The Treasurer denies tbe state ment that taxation is increasing. The rate per bead, he rays, is steadily going down, as thus— In 1891 £2 12b. od., in 1892 £2 10b. 9d~_m 1833 £2 6s. fid., and in 1894 £2 4s. 7d. The BUI passed at 8.16 p.m., Mr. Moule taking Mr. Catt'e place in committee. Mr. Grainger, on clause 2, took a test vota as to whether it ahoald be permissible to issue bands as well as inscribed atook, and the Government won by 2? rotes to &. The rest of the Bfll went through rapidly, only a few technical abera tioas being made. Mr. Aril, when the acheduls cum on at 9.3, tried to simplify it> informa tion by giving detaila. but he was beaten by 29 voccn to 8. Off the first item, '• Railways and equipment, £200,470,"" a anm of fIOOkWQ was struck by the owttng vote of the chair man, the numbers 17 on ""fh side. There was a lone debate oa the proposal by Mr. Gile* to wipe £160,000 from the line ""water works, £379,009,"" but after an hour had been (spent in talk tbe larger amount stood by 20 votes to 11. Without envisions, though not without antagonism, these lines went through: — Harbor improvement*, £3,900; jetties. £3,700; defences, £4,170; caoEtractioa of roads, 130.000; improvements ao pastoral leases, £300,000; building*, fee., £3^800; drainage, £5,000. Mr. Ash triad to reduce to OJ.OOO the item ""other loan works, £87,000,"" ae a protest against tbe unauthorised expenditure at St. Kilda and tfae illegal ad vances to village settlers. Be -was, however, beaten by 24 votes to those of Messrs. Ash, Caatine, Giles, £- W. Hawker, Johnson, and MacLachlan. The schedule was then passed as amended, and the Bill went,, through its remaaiinfr stag**.

The ""Social Reform"" party has lost one of its most active workers by the death of Mr. E. J. Hiscock, which ■ occurred on Sunday morn ing after a week's illness. Mr. Hiscock was the editor of the now defunct Voice newspaper, and took part in all movements having- for their object the furtherance of the principles which that journal was established to promote. He was an avowed singie-taxer, a supporter of woman's suffrage, and was generally identified with the advocacy of labor interests. He was greatly esteemed by a wide circle of friends who were impressed by his sincerity, and whose affection he had won by his kindly disposition. Mr. Hiscock, who was still in early manhood, was only married a month or so ago. He was born at Gawler,_ and was for many years identified with cricket there. Coming to the city he joined the\Adelaides, and for some years, he had been one of the mainstays of that club, and had also represented the colony in intercolonial matches. Mr. Hiscock, who was only 2(5 years of age, died at the residence of Mrs. Coltman, at Alberton. He was ,born at Roseworthy on April 8, 18GS. During his connection with cricket Mr. Hiscock visited New South-Wales and Victoria with intercolonial teams:- On Saturday week, while playing pricket, he was' struck in the abdomen with a cricket ball. In flammation of the bowels, accelerated by a quantity of cherries which the deceased had eaten, supervened and although every effort which medical skill could suggest to save him was used he sank and died. Oil Wednesday last, as a final resource, an operation was per formed, but it failed to give relief. The de ceased had only been married a few weeks ago to Miss E. Coltman, whose father died less than a fortnight ago. - Before the close of the meeting of' the Ade laide. Democratic Club- on Sunday night Mr. Sellar moved a vote of condolence with the widow of Mr. Hiscock, whose untimely death they all regretted. Mr. Buttery seconded the motion, and mentioned the great loss the cause had sustained by the death of Mr. Hiscock. The motion was carried. At the close of an"" eloquent sermon on "" Christian Socialism"" at the Norwood Baptist Church last night the Rev. Charles Bright made an impressive reference to the loss sus tained by the reform party. ' He observed that had the Emperor of China or my Lord Tomnoddy died nothing short of a funeral sermon would have been expected from him, but it was time that men like Mr. Hiscock, who devoted their lives to the service of humanity, were honored, instead of being allowed to pass away in silence. The preacher paid a glowing tribute to the enthusiasm, amounting to infatuation, with which Mr. Hiscock had sought by pen and voice to bring about a, social system based on justice. Mr. Hiscock was an earnest and courageous worker and a loving friend, and the preacher hoped that the place lie had left so conspicuously vacant a score of others would come forward to fill."

' When the ReytiUr went to presa on Saturday morning tho House of Assembly was debating the schedule for the Loau Bill. The item linfnm thrt Hhair wnn £1 fiflfl fnr TCinff Georges Sound defences. The Treasurer said a compact had boen made to defend King Goorga's Sound as a coaling station, Thursday Island, and «he oahle landing at Port Darwin. As to King George's Sound Western Aus tralia kept the garrison, her contribution being £5,000. The other colonies paid in proportion to tho population, and the amounts were : — Now South Wale?, £4,401 ; Victoria, £4,313 ; Queensland, £1.556 ; and South Aus tralia, £1,244. Since then additional expenses had been created, making South Australia^ share £1,488. The Imperial Government had ooutributed the material and armament. The lino was not an annual ono. The linn was passed. The next itom was Thursday Island, £2,670. The Treasurer said the coat of the defence works theru was £23,053, and additional ex penses hod been in a Jo to the extent of £21,573. The shares of the colonios were : — Isew South Wales, £S,000 ; Victoria, £7,900 ; South Aus tralia, £2,200 ; Wost'-rn Australia, £oS7 ; tnd Queensland, £2,S8U. There was no obligation on tha part of South Australia to p&y the money until the othsr colonies had contri buted towards proteasing the landing of the cable at Port Darwin. Queensland had not done so, aud the money would not ba ipont until the agreement waa fulfilled. To Major Castinu— He regretted that they had not been able to sell the Glenelg- guns. The line was passed. Mr. Grainger took a bold attitude on the vote for the construction of roads, £50,000. Although it would make him un popular, he protested against the money for the purpose being oharged to loan. It should be paid for out of revenue. It was financially wrong to engage in unreproductive works. He knew hon. uiombers did not like to oppose it because they all wanted to be in the swindle. It was a bribe. At 3.30 Mr. Solomon sustained the parable. Though members did not rush to the defence of the line they voted pretty solidly for it, aa the following division, which dieolosea the names of members present, will show : — A.YES, 25— Messrs. Archibald, Brirtlett, Bfttehelor, Blacker, Brooker, CastinB, Cockbnrn, Conoybeer, Foster, Oiilen, Hooper, Hunrigau, iiowe, Jenkins, Kingston, Landseer, McDonald, MacGillirray, McPheraon, O'Loughlin. Pojuton, Price, Short, Wood, and Holder feller). Ii'oss, 8— Messrs. Kollv, Solomon, and Grainger (teller). Majority of 22 for tho Ayes. On the line pastoral improvements £400,000, Mr. Grainger said the r scent vote showed that members borrowed not expecting to pay baok, and intended to retire behind the petti aoats of the women. Mr. Grainger left the House in disgust. Mr. Bartlett also objected to thia swindle. To Mr. Moule the Treasurer aaid the total loan money available for this parposs was £233,555, of which £83,000 was cash. Against thnt- thoro was to be paid this year amounts actually due, £126,000. In 1805 G the amount would be £i27,(-00, 1S9G-7 £153,000, ond the year after £230,000, ao that a further sum of £402,000 was required. Mr. Brooker moved to strike out £400,000 and insert £200,000. The larger sum would not be reqnired for yeare, and if the strings were pulled properly the pastoralists would be given the land, and the improvements would not need to be paid for. Mr. Bartlett advised a revaluation. After Mr. McPherson bad objeoted to giving the Treasurer tco much power, the Treasurer climbed down and accepted the amendment. Mr. MoPhcrson waa disgusted with the Government, and Mr. Poynton chastised the talkative members. He also referred to a scandalous valuation of im provements. At a quarter past 4 the line was passed ad £200,000. At thia time the morn ing newspapers were circulated in the House, and several members soon became absorbed in the contents. On the line for drainage south-Eastern land £5,000, the Treasurer explained that %i the survey had not been made they had deter mined not to have tho main drain made this year. Another reason why they did not ask Parliament to authorise the work wae bscause they were determined to carry it out on tho betterment principle, and until they had the surveys they could not apportion the amount;. Unless they got the money from the people before the drains were made they would not get it afterwards. To Mr. MoPherson the Treasurer r.dded that the Government in tended, when ib was decided to go on with the works, to gather up unexpended loau balances and introduce a Transfer Bill to divert them to the South-Eastern drainage works. To Mr. Bartlett, who referred to mistakes in the past, he mentioned that the works wonld be entrusted to Mr. Graham Stewart, C.E. The line wan passed. The Treasurer told Mr. Brooker that there was a balance of £7,100 in hand for purchase of land for homesteads. The vote for £10,000 for the same object and the other items were paieed. At half-paat 4 the resolution was reported for a loan of £930,500. Consideration of the report wan fixed for to-day. The Hon. A. Catt was again in the chair on tha Council's amendments to the Factories Bill. The Minister of Education stat«d that the majority of the amendments oould be accepted without injury to the measure. All the amendments but 7, 8, 9, 10, and 15 wore agreed with. The others wero disagreed from. Dr. Cockburn objeoted to No. 8. The Bill allowed not more than fifty hours a week over time, and the amendment waa to double the allowance. A clause prohibited the employ ment of a woman for a month after childbirth, and tho Council struck out the clause, but tho Assembly inaisted upon its reinstatement. Amendment No. 10, to provide that any ohild whn ha.ii tisiMMi thfl nmnnul-irirv Htaniiarri could be employed it the luepoctor taou^ututi, was opposed by the Mi uister. Mr. Solomon thought it should be agreed to. There were many branches of light work in a factory whioh the children with a fair education could perform. Mr. Grainger thought there was something in the amendment. There was a lot of things boys could do. Newepaper boys turned out tho beet coloniatn. lie would move to strike out ' Inspector'' and inner! ' Minis ter of Education.' Mr. Batohelor counselled them to stick to an age limit. Mr. Grainger — I know buys of 9 who can run rings round boys of 13. Mr. Batchelor — Aud smart boys m»y run rings round m6n of 45.- (Laughter.) Mr. Graioger — And boys can run rings round members of Parliament. In day light, at 5 o'oloek, Mr. Granger's amendment wes rejected by 25 to 17. There were two amusing incidents in the divi sion. The Miniatbriahsts found Mr. Wood asleep ou she other aide. The Whip awakened him. He rubbed bis eye?, yawned, and mecha nically followed Mr. O'Loughliu across tho House. Mr. Brooker had been overlooked. As soon as tho Premier eaw it he wunc after his tired 'l:unb,'' roused him, and led him acrcfis tho floor ; but Mr. Gruinger smartly named both the Promier and Mr. Brooker as voting on tiis sido, whereupon chey had, amidst laughter, to go up to the Cable and de olare their wishes. Mr. Solomoii pleaded against the manufacture of lurrikins. Mr. Graiug6r said some of the greatest names in history were thoae o: men and women who had to earnalivingunderthirteen years of age. A young girl could not bo employed at a Creche minding a baby. An Hou. Member— But a Creohe ia not a. manufactory. Mr. Solomon — This is democracy run mad. Mr. Grainger objected to th*6 generalization. Democracy w(i9 good on right lines. Wuila the division bells were ringing Mr. Grainfjer exhibited undue warmth. He offered to take the platform against any Labour member on the point, and muttered something about moiin, measly, and distrusting conduct. The Premier, forgetting his indignation at Mr. Grainier for reporting him on the previous morning, asked it that was in order, but the Chairman took no notice The amendment was rejected by 18 to 12. The Minister objected to the nesb amendment to omit clause 25, which restrioted definition of factories for apparel to a workshop where four or moro perbons wero employed. Mr. Solomon supported the Council, called for u division, but withdrew it. The reasons were brought up and adopted. The Women's Suffrage Bill had a brief spell in Committee at half-past 5. Mr. Solomon asked for an adjournment, but the Premier wanted to make progress. The Hon. J. H. Howe said if he were not afforded an oppor- tunity to amend the Bill he would vote against the third reading. Mr. Griffiths— Mean con- temptible trickery. Mr. McPherson raised the question of property qualification, where upon the Premier reported progress. Mr. Moule — What, another climb down! The Committee had leave to sit again on Monday. The Minister of Education moved the second reading of the Rural Industries Bill. After an r.llueion to the meat indu-try he referred particularly to the prospects of co-operative wineries. They would bs as much buccsfb as tho co - operative butter factories, and result; ia a uniform quality. The manu facture of sugar for beet was an ex ceedingly promisine production in all colonies with a climate like South Australia, and in other countries it had eriven etnploy mont to thousands. The next industry was the manufacturo of oonoeutrated milk, wnioh had been a great success in Vic toria. The larse vessel* in3t*ad of_ carry ing a oow carried a supply of this oon centrated milk, whioh would last from Vic toria to England and back. The sample was tha best iii tho world. As to compressed fodder there would be nn knmsnse tr-de with Western Austrfilia. The advantage was that chaff could be reduced to such small space. One ton could bs reduced to 40 cubic feet, otherwise it occupied 140 feet. Upon the motion of Major Castine the debate was adjourned until ZvlDndiiy. The Minister of Education moved the second reading of the Standard Time Bill, re ceived from tue Legislative Council. Queens land had pa3sod un Act, New South Wales had wired that tho Bill had passed through Committee. The second reading waa earned, and tho Bill was taken through all stages and pas?e«i. Mr. Brooker, referring to the rapid passage of the Bill— We neve made time at lflBt. The Northern Territory Jury Bill waa read a second time and taken through all the other stiigos. It was now five minutes to 6, and the eleotrio illumination disappeared, but the natural light waa hardly sufficient^ for Mr. Grainper's eyesight, end ho complained with his customary vigour. The Civil Service Amendment Bill was then taken in Committee. This waa the msasare which had beim robbed of its* body. Major Casfcino moved to insert tha following opera tive clause :— Leave of absence may he granted, pursuant to the 'Civil Service Aineudmenc Act, 1881,' to any person in the employ of ttie South Australian Go vernment, excluding the South Aimtralian railways, whfther such person shall b* employed on tho flxud or tbn proVisi nal and temporary list, but so thut Hiu-h leava -hall only bo granted on account of aurvice snbjeqiittnt to the passing of thia Act. Mr. Brooker and Mr. MoPherson both arpued that it should apply to the Railway Commissioners. The Premier explained that the railway umployds were dealt with by special iegiblation, aud Major CasSine men tioned that he had not been granted per mission to touch the Railway Ooinmiagioners Act. The Promier promised Mr. Wood to oonsider tho matter during recess. The clause was carried, and the Bill wa» reported, and carried thronc'ii the remaining stages. The House adjo.irnftd at one minute past 6 o'oloek a.m. till 2 o'clock on Monday, and members went home in the drizzle to break fast. In the list of mombara present during the Thursday all-nigbs sitting, Mr. Moule's name was inadvertently dropped. Tho order of the business to-day is asfoilows : — Women's Suffrage Bill in Committee, re oort of the Committee on the loan proposals, Railway Oomrniasioners Aofc Amendment Bill, Lake Bouney Settlement Bill, and State Child rens Bill."

MISMANAGEMENT IN THE ASSEMBLY.",Article,"South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)",17-12-1894,Article,4814,"Ihe Jkjfofter, Adelaide: Monday, Dec. 17, 1894. MISMANAGEMENT IN THE ASSEMBLY. The business of tha Assembly has been badly managed this year, and last week's experience supplied the most impressive amongst several proofs of the fact. The all-night sittings of Thursday and Friday furnished striking evidence of the results of bungling methods or imperfect designs. Early in the session members dawdled over nothing in particular, and Ministers gave them few matters of moment to con sider. The middle of the period was devoted, with slight exceptions, to the discussion of Ministerial pro posals regarding which there was no pretence of urgency. Only towards the close of the Parliamentary year was an energetic effort made to deal with the real business for which members were cailed together. Even now, in the beginning of the final week of the session, tbe Estimates remain partly unconsidered, whilst the other finan cial papers have not been touched, and the Pastoral Bill haa only just reached the Council. Such facts as these show that the Premier lias not been lately so good a manager as ho is generally supposed to be, or else that he has reasons for not wishing to see much progress made in tho Assembly. For the unsatisfactory character of the session's record cannot be fairly attri buted to a turbulent or factious Opposi tion. During many years past no other Ministry has had so much of its own way in Parliament as the King3ton Cabinet haB enjoyed. Onco or twice only have dis tinctly obstructive tactics been practised, with the consequence of forcing the House unnecessarily into a late sitting ; but the offenders on more than one of these iccasionshavebeen supporters of the Ministry. The Premier has before now raised the cry, 'Sea how we have been obstructed !' when the action miscalled obstruction has been forced upon independent members. They hav9 been compelled thus to protest against a mismanagement of business which seemed to indicate little thought for the convenience of legislators, and not much concern for the publio interest. Just now, indeed, there is a ridiculous tendency to stigmatize ss ob struction what should be welcomed as searching criticism. There is also an absurd disposition to, represent that who evor opposes what Ministers propose is no patriots but & pernicious plotter agains tho commonwealth. It is noteworthy that throughout tho unconscionably late and-early meet ings of . tha Assembly last week there was little or no stonewall ing. We are not sure, however, that this is tha most gratifying thing which could bo said. Stonewalling — like physic — is sometimes necessary. Good results might have followed from determined aud practical protest against the highly discreditable manner in which the business of the House was con ducted. After keeping the Council's mossage regarding the Taxation Bill on tho Assembly Notice-paper for some weeks Ministers suddenly awoke to the fact that it waa there, and forthwith members were required to deal with the matter in a violent hurry in one night. The loan proposals, as thoy include pro vision for practically no new under takings, mit;ht easily have been intro. duced three months ago. If they had been members would have had time to think over them, and tj discuss them. But no. The proposition for the expendi ture of considerably more than a million pounds sterling must needs be kept back by the Government until the eleventh hour, and then brought forward in such a fashion as virtually to preclude the pos sibility of the House having a full com prehension of the real issues involved in the Loan Bill. This is tho more remarkable because there iB no absolute need for authorising any loan during the present session. But look ac the con sequences of the policy of loiter and haste which the Ministry have adopted ! Consider tho miserable spectacle pre sented by the Assembly on Friday night ! In ordinai*y circumstances it is as much as the average politician can do to closely follow the course of important business before the chair ; but 9ii this extraordinary occasion votea iffecting hundreds of thousands of pounds were taken in a House almost half Bmpty, and less chan half-conscious of what was being done. The taxpayers will have to toil and slave to raise money for repayment of principal and interest in connection with this proposed new loan ; yet while the iuthoriziog resolutions were being passed several members, worn out by iheer fatigue, slumbered in blissful )blivion to what was being done. Ehese had to be aroused so that ihey might vote in divisions upon pro Dosals which they had nothearddiscussed,' md in one instance at least a repre sentative of the people could not be summoned from dreamland quickly mough to enable him to cross over ;o his party's side. And thiB is termed egislating — lawmaking. At another itage of the proceedings only one Minister iras awake, and it was unreasonable to jxpect him to be as competent to jx plain the business beforo the House as he was twelve or thirteen lours before, when the weary jrocess of fagging-out began. Nor could proper attention to any explanation be 'airly required from the few insomnia ;roubled members who listened or tried to isten to it. In fact, such day and night littings as those which were held ast week cannot be too strongly con lemned. The proceedings marking them legenerate into mere legislative farces without a mirth-producing quality. It is impossible for tho public to feel much respect for or confidence in Parliament while such things continue, and the sooner this fact is taken to heart the bettvr for our Parliamentary in stitutions. So far an Saturday morning's transactions are concerned' it is hardly more surprising than gratify ing that the Assembly succeeded in re ducing the loan schedule to the extent o^ £200, 000. This alteration shows that tb e criticism directed against the peculiar pro' posals of the Government was not alto gether useless. But the circumstances in which it was mado lead also to another conclusion. If the details of the schedule — a schedule composed of curious shreds and patches— had been considered in a wakeful House they might have been amended with still more advantage to the taxpayer. For the tax payer comes distinctly into the question. It is he who has to bear the brunt of Parliamentary blunders, whether they be committed whilo legislators are conscious or whilo they are only in a somnambu listic condition. The Chajiwox Fotjhs.— Tha Rowing Association made a mistake in arranging to havo tho Champion Fours contested so soon after the Torrens Regatta. A crew training on the short and awkwardly curved city course is severely handi capped when meeting in a three-mile race a club which can row if necessary seven miles straight away, and which practises on the scene of the race. To tbis must be attributed the fact that only two clubs entered for the important event which carries with it the hand some silver challenge cup presented to the Association by Mr. F. W. Bullock. Owing to watermanship and the advan« tages of their situation for training and practice the Port Club were fully ex pected to form tho Champion Fours, bub on Saturday the Commercial Club, with the same crew which had carried off tha senior prizes at the regatta, won tho prize. The race was rowed from end to end without foul or accident, and wan won on its merits by the better crew. The winners had a good long forward reach ; their catch was Eharp and de cisive, withouc waste of time in getting into the water ; their recovery was slow and massive, as it ought to be ; and they had good body swing. They have still, however, something to acquire in getting the hands quickly away, while one of their oars is conspicuous for not finishing hia work with his shoulders well held back, but for trusting to tho most useless of rowing muscles, the biceps ; and another has cultivated to perfection that style of finish which is known as 'turning the grindstone.' The losers deserve, on their part, credit for rowing a race which after tbe first 150 yards was a hopeless stern chase, us game as it was severe. Their No. 2 pulled in a style, so far as work is concerned, we have never seen surpassed, and not often equalled ; and his prostration at the end of the race showed what a tax he had put upon heart and lungs. Butthecrewas a wholo suffered manifestly from the want of coaching. The Champion Eights are not to bo rowed till March, and the inter vening time is sufficient to try all the available talent, and to coach the final selection into something like correct form. Those likely to be represented in the greator event in March should recol lect that mere strength without form is of no use in & class of boat wherein science plays a part so important as it does in the modern outrigger with slides. They should bear in mind further that thorough concord amongst the members of a crew is of as much consequence as keeping time and keeping stroke. The fact of a man being a successful oarsman is no guarantee that he has nothing further to learn. On the contrary, old oars in a crew frequently give moat trouble, as it is very difficult to unteach them the faults they contract. The more perfect an oarsman is himself the more conscious is he of his own sliortcomings. There is a lesson to be gathered from the lata University Fours at Oxford. The win ning crew, New College, is eaid to be one of tbe finest fours ever seen on the Isis. Three of the four weie in the winning boat for the Visitors' Cup at Henley, while the fourth was 7 in the Eton Eight who won thfl Ladies' Challenge. Thoy took as much pains in their training as if they were a crew of novices of inferior material, and woro careful to do every thing to make victory a certainty. Akrival op the Himalaya.— The R.M.S. Himalaya, of the P. & O. Line, and tbe present holder of the record between England and the colonies, dropped anchor at the Sema phore in the eatly houra of Saturday ruorninfr. The steamer's arrival at the outuapei was anxiously looked for on Friday evening, but owing to the telegraph line becoming twisted no advice of her having passed Cape Borda was received. Tho vessel passed Cape Borda at 10.3S on Friday night, and her signals were answered from the lighthouse. The boarding officers v/ere outi early on Saturday morn ing in anticipation of the Himalaya's arrival, aud at -1.15 the outlines of the steamer could be plainly seen in the ofling. She dropped anohor at 5.30, and shortly afterwards pratique was granted by Mr. R. Jagoe. The record trip of the Hima laya was pat up in June, 1893. She is always an early boat, and generally makes a mail delivery nf about a week ahead of contract time. On the two previous occasions on which ehe has arrived this year ahe anchored at the Semaphore at 7.30 on a Saturday morning and 2.80 on a Sunday afternoon. On this occasion the Himalaya was only twenty-eight days ont from London. As usual, ehe was a full ahip. For weeks before ahe left Ti'bury a berth could not be obtained, and when the old country was left bshind there were 359 passengers on board in all classes. A number were landed en route, but on arrival here there' were still over 2S0 passengers. Tha voyage waa marked by a continuance of cold weatber, with galea in the Bay of Biscay. Ab Gib raltar the Channel fleet waa found ab anchor, and on Friday uiplit the festivi ties on board were brought to a termination by a fancy dress ball. Among the paesenRera was tbe Hon. W. Forrest, of Queensland, Chairman ol Directors of tbe Queensland Meat Export Company, who went to England in March Ia3t to promote the frozen-meat trado. The Hon. N. Fitzgorald, of Victoria, also returned, and was met by Colonel Gordon. Mr. Henry Varley, the well-known evangelist, accom panied by Mre. Varloy, is paying another visit to the colonies. There wero forty pas sengsra from Western Australia. The Hima laya resumed the voyage to Melbourne the ?anie day. The Acstria - Hungarian Copulate. —Mr. C. L. Meyer has received a cablegram from London asking him to take temporary charge of the Austria- Hungarian Consulate in South Australia rendered vaoant by thfl death of Mr. A. Von Treuer. Supreme COURT.— Saturday wai the Last Day of Term, and Eis Honor the Chief Justice presided at 10.30. The first business done was the' formal admission of Mr. George Ash, M.P., as a practitioner of the Supreme Court, he taking the usual oaths. The pro Feasion waa well represented, including the Premier (Hon. C. C. Kingston, Q.C.), the Drown Solicitor, und other leading members of the Bar. His Honor made absolute the con ditional order for the admission of Frank jordoa Toller. T3£, Continued on Page
5 Scroll to previous page Death of Dr. Mayo.— We to-day record the death of Dr. George Mayo, a very old Adelaide worthy, at the advanced age of eighty-seven. Dr. Mayo was a well-known figure in Adelaide for many years, and almost to the last he was engaged in the active practice of his profession. He found much pleasure of late years in the use of a tricycle to aid him in moving in and around the city. Among all classes he was deeply respected, and his death causes a blank that will be very noticeable in the community. In another column are some biographical particulars of the late gentle- man. TLvivERsirr ok Adelaide.— The annual commemoration of the Univeraity, a fnnction whioh is always largely attended, will be held on Wednesday of this week, beginning at 3.15 p.m. His Excellency the Governor hat signified his intention of being present, and the Chanoellor will preside.

Dr. Stirling will duliver tlie annual address. Mr. George Ash, M.F.— A new tirm of barristers and solicitors haa been created under the style of Kingston & Aah, Mr. George Ash, M.P. for Albert, who was admitted as a practitioner of the Supremo Court on Saturday morning, having entered into partnership with the Hon. 0. 0, Kingston, Q.C., M.P. (the Attorney-General), with whom he served his artioles. At the end of his first) Parliamentary session in 1S:)1 Mr. Ash decided to adopt the lav? as his profession. He passed the necessary matricu lation examination at the Adelaide University in Maroh, 1891, and sinca then haj completed the four years' course for the LL.B. degree, being the first student to obtain that degree under tho new regulations. His oaraer at the Univeraity has been moit brilliant, and in entering into business on the day of his admission to the Bar he pro bably beats tha record in this colony. Directly he was admitted to praotise Mr. Arthur Hardy, one of the oldest lawyers in Adelaide, teadernd Mr. Ash his first brief, which the new lawyer accepted. Mr. Hardy at one time reprosonted Albert iu the As sembly, and was defeated by Mr. Aeh. This unusual complimont paid to the member for Albert was therefore a graceful act on the part of the ox-politician. Mr. Ash is thirty five yeara of age. Soon after ha came to the colony — about) fifteen years ago — hs joined the staff of the Border fFatck at Mount Gambier, and ahortly afterwards went to the Narra coortc Herald, which waa then owned by the proprietors of the Border Watch, »nd which was purchased later by Mr. Ash and his partner, Mr. J. B. Mather. Med3H. Mather and Ash conducted the Herald until the famous libel acSiou whioh was brought against the paper, and Boon afterwards Mr, Ash entered Parliament!. The Rev. J. C. Hatnes.— Mr. Haynos, who this month ib severing his connection with St. Peter's College, was born in the South of Ireland, and came to Sonth Aus tralia at a V6ry early age. After some years at St. Peter's College he returned to Europe to complete his a udies. He entered the Royal University, Ireland, and at the Matri oulation Examination came out head of the list, obtaining the tirst Scicnoe Scholarship. Coming out again to South Australia he joined the teaching staff of St. Peter's under the Head Mastership of Archdeacon Farr. Soon after this he was ordained deacon and priest by the late Bishop Short. He had many offers of preferment in the Church, which, acbiner under the advice of the Bishop, ho declined. He advanced by degrees in his profession, until he received tho appoint ment of Third Master and Bursar of the College, which he has held for eight years. Mr. Hayna3 haa been a very successful schoolmaster, and haa excellent testimonials frooi Archdeacon Farr, Mr. Stanford, and Mr. Raynor, all of whom speak in the highest terms of bis good work amongst the junior boys, and of his uniform success in preparing boya for the University Examinations. In addition to performing his soholastio work Air. Haynes has also been actively engaged in Church work in the Diocese, having for many years had charge of tbe missionary district including Salisbury, Virginia, and Enfield, and for a short timo of St. Cuthbert'a, Prospect. He also held the appointment of chaplain at the Adelaide Gaol in sonjunotion with the lato Rev. J. Pollitt, and was a Vice-President of the Church of England Sunday-school Union. Now that Mr. Haynes has retired from S£ Peter's College we believe it is his intontion to carry on scholastic work on hia own account. Miss Spence and Woman's Suffrage. —The question of woman's suffrage, with special reference to the Bill now before Parliament, will be discussed at the welcome meeting to be given to Miss Spence by friends of woman's suffrage at the Cafe de Paris, Rundle-street, to-night at 3 o'clock. Miss Spence, Mrs. Nicholls, Miss George, the Rev. J. D. Thomp son, and other speakers will deliver addresses, and a resolution will be moved urging members of Parliament to vote for the third reading, and not cast away their votes on the pretext of pairing. The meeting is open to the public, and all friends of woman's suffrage and social reform are urged to attend. Saturday's Senior Cricket.— The three senior matches begun on November 24 and continued on December 8 were completed on Saturday. The Hindmarhh scored SOS for 5 wickets against tho Adelaides' 305, Frud .Tarvis batting brilliantly for 1(S!) not out. At the other end c ' tho Adelaide Oval the North Adelaides scoring 250 for 7 wickets put in the shade the Port Adelaides' total of 242. A. Hill played fine cricket for 101 not out. At .Kensington tbe Norwoods, for whom Green niftdo (u not out, could raise no more than 203 against the South Adelaides' huge total of 485. The MilitauV.— On Saturday afternoon the lancers mustered in strong force under Captain Rowoll on tho parade ground, North terrace. After going through lance exercises thuy performed a musical ride under tho orders of Sergoant-Major D& Passey. During thu afternoon the machine-gun corps had gun drill under the command of Captain Cote on the parade ground, and Militia Infantry classfiring took place at the Port Ranges. Straxge Death of an Infant.— On Satur day Dr. Jiirs reported to the Port Police Station that he bad been called to attena an infant child of Mra. Horwood at Alberton on that morning. He found that the., child had apparently been dead for two or three days, and he therefore refuaud to give a certificate of burial. It appears that no ono besides the mother knew of the birth of tho child. The woman, whose huaband died about eighteen months ago, states that the child had been born premacnrely. The police pioseouted enquiries, and tho Coroner was informed. Dr. Toll was asked to make an examination of the child and to give a report on the case. This he did later on Sunday, and gave a certificate, whioh was accepted by the Coroner. The Viixagb Settlers.— The effort whish the Ladies' Committee of the Village Settle ment Aid Society ia making to raise a Christ maa Gift Fund is meeting with a fair amount of success. In addition to the ordinary modes of collection they on Saturday inaugurated in Ade'.aido a niothod long existent in connection with hospital collec tions in London and other large cities, and whioh may ultimately become a favourite plan hero. It is possible that sanguine friends of the settlors may not care to apply the term 'successful' to the result of Satur day's collection, yet a sum of £G0 is a substantial amount in these dull times. Collecting stations were established at the Glenelg Railway Station, the Town Hall, Messrs. Sorymgour's, Halt's Corner, and Howeli's Comer, in King William-street; Hooper's Corner, in Hindley-street ; aad in Rundle-straflt aS Messrs. Crooks &. Brooker'a, Messrs. Birks'a ohemiBt t-hop, the Arcade, Messrs. Fitch's Corner, Messrs. Craven and Armstrong's Corner ; at the corner of East terrace ; and at the Zoological Gardens and the Adelaide Railway Station. There was also a station at the Glenelg Jetty. The ladies remained at their posts from 12 to 6 p.m., and those in liundlo-street until 9.30 p.m. It speaks well for the good behaviour of the passera-by that with a very few excep tions nothing unpleasant occurred. The sum collected, supplemented by contributions from other sources, ebould help to assure the Bettlers in sorae very substantial way that tbe good folks in Adelaide do not forget them at Christmas time. The Markkts.— Tn Rnticipation of a rise in prices for the Christmas msrkeS there waa a good supply of everything to Friday night's markot, but) there was no advance. The Christmas market this year will be held on Monday morning next instead of Tuesday. Broken Hitl will be supplied with Christmas goods from Saturday's market, as Mouday's train would be too lato, bat the locul customers and the townships within a day's journey .of Adelaide will be able to obtain tueir articles fresh on Monday. New Zealand Shipping- Company's Steamep.3.— We learn from Mesers. G. Wills and Co. that the steamers of the New Zealand Shipping Cempaay, Limited, will in future mako Monte Video an extra port of call. The Recent Village Ssttcbment Case. — Mr. E. C. Crocker, Hon. Secretary to the Holder Village Association, writes: — 'On behalf of the settlers and trustees of the above Association I crave a few lines to refute certain statements in your report of the pro osodings of the Supreme Court in the case of Mary McMillan, aliai Anderson. 1st. The trustaoa winh it to be known that Mrs. Ander son went to town on her own responsibility, and was not eeut down by the Board. 2nd. Mrs. Anderson was granted the loan of £1 for her fare to the city, bIio intimating that she bad friends waiting to receive her. 3rd. She was not destitute, her Rt&tement being that she had funds in the oity. iih. She hud no Deed tr- go to town. ' Serious Accident.— An aooident happened to the eon of Mr. G. E. Morgan on Saturday evening. Some children were playing in Gouger-stroet when the well-known aboriginal Tommy Walker made a run towards them. Thachfldren were frightened, and in trying to get away little Morgan, who is about five years of age, fell down, and was run over by a cab driven by Mr. Waller with three or four passengers. The ohild was driven to Dr. O'Connell, who upon examination stated that he was suffering from a crushed liver and bruised kidneys. The little fellow is slightly better, but fears are entertained that inflam mation will set in. Death of an old Colonist.—On Friday another of the old colonists of South Australia passed away at Albert Park in the person of Mrs. Barton. The deceased lady, who was seventy-eight years of age, arrived in the year 1836, and was therefore a pioneer of fifty-eight years. Mrs. Barton was born in Kent, and came to South Australia when nineteen years of age. She married about two years afterwards and had three sons and three daughters. She lived for the most part at Burton, near Salisbury, but she also resided at Pine Forest. Mr. Barton died many years ago. The deceased lady leaves four children—a son and a daughter having died—and nineteen grand- children. Disowning Accident at Glen Osmond.— A oasa of drowning occurred at the Glen Osmond Quarry on Sunday afternoon. A lad of between eleven and twelve years, eon of Mr. A. J. Day, of Frawville, in company with a younger brother and several other boys, was bathing in a waterhole at the quarry, when he got out of hia depth. His companions at once went to Mr. J. H. Wyles's residence, and he returned with them to the v.'aterhole, and aftsr diving three or four times recovered tho body. Endeavours were made at resuBoitation for three-quarters of an hour, but without success. Dr. Corbin wa& also sent for, but he could do nothing. Organ* Aitoistjient. — Mr. William T. Staoy haa been appointed organist and choir master to St. Andrew's Church, WakeBeld street, a position rendered vacant through the removal of Mr. D. B. Adanuon to Perth, Western Australia.

Bao., holds the first class certificate in organ playing from the University in connection with the looal musioal examinations. Children's Hospital and the Deutscheb Foutscfiritts Vkhein. — The favourite holiday resort of tho Glanatuort (Fourth Creek Waterfall) was availed of by the Deut usher Fortschritts Verein, on the Prince of Wales Birthday by permission of the occupier of tha land, who aska for contributions for the Children's Hospital from all visitors.

Die Reap- zeit ist hier in vollem Gange. Die Ernte wird mäßig aus- fallen. Futter ist reichlich vorhanden und das Vieh gut im Stande. Alle Straßen find voll Swagmen. die keine Ar- bei! finden können; futtern muß sie jeder Farmer alle Tage zwei bis drei Mal. Was nächsten Winter werden wird, j das mag der liebe Gott wissen. Wenn Sie nach Neujahr keinen bessern Weizenpreis berichten, werden wohl viele Farmer Swagmen werden ; es sieht in der That traurig aus im Lande. Was die Stadt betrifft, so liest man blos von Bällen, Konzerten, Theater und anderen Vergnügungen. Die Städter scheinen alles, was nur zu wünschen ist, zu bekommen, aber wenn man sich im Lande umsteht und be- denkt, was der Farmer für alle seine Produkte bekommt, und rechnet Steuern und Rates ze. ab, wer hat da das bessere Loos ? (Nun, dem Durchschnitts-Siädter geht es zur Zeit auch wohl kaum besser, als dem Landwirte. Hier oder da drückt fast einem Jeden der Schuh. D.Red.) Wir wünschten unsere Parlamenter hielten mehr Umschau im Lande, dann würden sie bald andere Ideen bekommen. Unsere Hoffnung können wir armen Farmer nur noch auf den lieben Gott setzen, sonst müßten wir ganz verzweifeln. Unsere Milizen werden im Verein mit dem Polizeikorps am 10. Januar, zu Ehren des scheidenden Gouverneurs, eine Abschiedspärade veranstalten. Am Dienstag letzter Woche, überbrachte der Abg. MePherson dem Unterhause eine Bittschrift, worin der Adelaider Stadtrat das Ansuchen stellt, die vorliegende Licensed Hawkers Bill abweisen zu wollen. Die bisherigen Verordnungen — heißt eS darin — feien vollkommen aus- reichend gewesen, und die Korporationen und Distrikt Coun- eils würden auch nur ungern ihre bisherige Machtbefugnis in der Lieenstersrage eingeschränkt sehen. In Grange kam am letzten Dienstag ein junger Mann, Albert Aldwell, durch Ertrinken ums Leben. Er hatte ein Bad genommen und war beim Ankleiden, als sein Hut in die See flog. Beim Versuche, demselben nachzu- schwimmen, verließen ihn entweder die Kräfte oder er wurde von Krämpfen befallen, jedenfalls war er längst tot, als Fischer des Körpers habhaft wurden. \ Petitionen, welche insgesamt die Namen von j 1558 Depositoren der südaustralischen Sparbank trugen, wurden am Dienstag letzter Woche dem Unterhaus« zu dem Zwecke unterbreitet, die Annahme der vorliegenden Stete Advances Bill zu hintertreiben. Die. Leute erklären sich j mit der gegenwärtigen Verwaltung der Anstalt vollkommen zufrieden und möchten nicht, daß die Kontrolle — wie obige Bill dies anstrebt — fast ganz in staatliche Hände übergeht. Die Petitionen kamen aus allen Teilen der Kolonie. ! In manchen Teilen von Unley sah es letzte Woche mit der Wasserversorgung schlecht aus. Stundenlang versagte die Leitung total und in den höher belegenen Ort-- schasten, wie Fullarton, konnte man fast den ganzen Tag hindurch keinen Tropfen Wasser bekommen. Was dies bei der grade herrschenden tropischen Hitze heißen will, läßt sich denken. Verschiedene Steuerzahler drohen dem Wasser- Departement mit einer Klage. E st e o » 1 1 House, die von einem Teil der Brown'- schen Hinterlassenschaft angekaufte, prächtig und gesund ge- legene Besitzung, ist nunmehr, nach Wunsch der hochherzigen Erblasserin, in ein Heim für verkrüppelte Kinder mittelloser Eltern umgewandelt worden. Die Verwaltung läßt bekannt/ machen, daß noch einige kranke Kinder dann Ausnahme sin- den können. Am letzten Dienstag Abend hat die Adult Suffrage Bill, nach welcher bekanntlich auch Frauen das allgemeine Wahlrecht zuerkannt bekommen, im Nntechause die zweite Lesung bestanden und zwar mit 23 gegen 11 Stimmen. Die Zoll-Einnahmen unserer Kolonie während der Zeit vom 1. Juli bis zum 3. Dezember beziffern sich auf £228,493 ; die entsprechende Periode des Vorjahres brachte £239,623 ; Minder-Emnahme somit L11,130. Ueön- gens hatte sich das Verhältnis in letzter Woche allein um den ansehnlichen Betrag von etwa .£5000 verbessert. Die Biersteuer brachte bis jetzt £5194 ein. Nach kurzem Krankenlager ist am vergangenen Montag in Minlaton Herr Dr. med. Andreas v. Nida an Bright' scher Nierenkrankheit verstorben. Der etwa 65jährige Herr hatte in früheren Jahren in Mount Pleasant, Blm- man, Porketown, Mannum und anderen Ortschaften prallt- ziert. Er hinterlaßt eine große erwachsene Familie. Wie entsetzlich unbedacht manche Leute sind hat sich dieser Tage einmal wieder in Minlaton erwiesen, wo eine Frau Walter Peterson eins im Erlöschen begriffene Spirituslampe wieder auszufüllen versuchte. Die natürliche Folge war, daß die Spiritusflasche explodierte und die MeidMgsstücke der Frau in Brand setzte. ^ Em Glück war nur, daß ihr Gatte zur Hand war und die Flammen mit Hilfe von. Decken noch ersticken konnten, ehe eZ zu spät ge- wesen wäre. Trotzdem hat Frau Peterson an den Armen und im Gesicht sehr schMerzhafie Brandwunden davongetra- ! gen. Anderen möge dieser Fall zu neuer Warnung dtenen. . G i n i n P o r t A u g u st a wohnhafter Bäcker, R. B. Randall, machte letzter Tage den Versuch, seinem Leben durch einen tiefen Schnitt in den Hals ein gewaltsames Ende zu machen. Randall litt seit längerer Zeit cm einem Gehirnleidsn ; sein Zustand ist keineswegs unbedenklich, ob wohl ärztliche Hilfe bald zur Stelle war. Der Kapitän des dieser Tage in Port Augusta eingetroffenen Segelschiffes „Alexander Black"" hat der Polizei die Meldung gemacht, daß sich ein 14jähriger Kajütenjunge, Jacob, de Graf, der in Antwerpen angemustert worden war,, während der Fahrt, offenbar Infolge leichtsinniger Hand- Hab.ung eines Revolvers, erschossen habe. Die Leiche war auf See begraben worden. Grunde zu irgend welchem Ver- dacht scheinen nach angestellten Erkundigungen nicht vorzu- liegen.

32,73204315,HARDWICKE COLLEGE.,Article,"The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889 - 1931)",19-12-1894,Article,1054,"RAEDWICKE COLLEGE. Theaonlia] concert and distribution of prizes inoonnectjon with Hardwicke College took place in the Adelaide Town Hall on Tuesday even ing, when tbe Bev. Joseph Berry presided over an audience which filled the building: to over flowing. The programme opened with a duet for two pianos 'Norma' (Bellini), which was given with correctness and precision by the Misses Beeton and Evans. Miss Cowling, a pupa of Mr. W. B. Pybus, sang ' The star of Bethlehem, 'herlowerand middle registers being decidedly good, although her upper notes were weak. Miss K. Gihuore, who recited 'Ohne Hast, Ohne Rast,' showed that she had the gift of elocution strongly dereloped, her enun ciation being- excellent and her delivery ex ceedingly good. The junior singing class, under the direction of Mr. T. W. Lyons, gave N. Geopfart's cantata, 'The Circle of the Seasons,' the choruses, of which there were six, being nicely eunjr by the little ones ; Miss M. Hill sinrnn^ a short solo in the finale. The concluding item of the programme consisted of excerpts from Wallaces opera, ' Lurline.' This work like its predecessor, 'Maritana,' is overflowing with melody, and the selections given by the senior class were judiciously chosen. They included the choruses, 'Hark, hark, the king advanceth,' 'Sail, sail on the midnight gale,' 'From his palace of crystal,' ' Peace to the memory of the brave,' and the quartet, 'Though the world with transport bless thee.' Mai-ing due allowance lor the absence of the necessary male voices, the .choruses were well arranged and given with precision and verve, both sopranos and altos being well up in their work. The soloists were Miss Beeton, who acquitted herself well in the soprano number 'Flow on, oh, silver Khine,'andMissChurch- ward, -whose pleasing contralto was heard to anch advantage in the charmine ballad 'Gentle troubadour' that she was compelled to reappear. The grand scena ''Sad as my soul' was song by Miss Pasbeld, who possesses a soprano of good quality and extended range slightly marred by a tendency to faulty intona tion. Her gJTiprinjr of this difficult number was on the whole fiighly creditable, but there was a lack of grace in her execution of the florid passages which further experience may rectify. The finale, 'O sing once more that song divine,' was capitally rendered, and brought an enjoyable concert to an end. Miss Tflly, A.C.P., having presented the annual report, The Chaiemah delivered a short address, in which he stated that that dayshould.be re garded as a red-letter day in the history of. the colony owing to the passing of the Women's Suffrage Bill,- and it was to scholastic institutions such as Hardwicke College that we should have to look to provide intelligent voters who would exercise their franchise aright. He congratulated the Misses Tilly upon the suc cess which had attended their labors during the past year, and expressed the hope that the coming one would beeven more successful. The Eev. J. Dat Thompson having briefly addressed the students, the distribution of scholarships and prizes took place, the list being as follows : — BAKDWICEE OOII^GE SCHOLARSHIPS AND PRIZE LIST, 1694.

Vezemver. > Nicht weniger als 42, von Depositoren der südcmstra- tischen Sparbank unterzeichnete, Hegen die vorliegende State Advances-Bill gerichtete Bittschriften liefen ein. Der Minister für öffentliche Arbeiten erklärte in Ant' Wort auf eine Frage des Abg. Price, seitdem die ueulichen Deputation bei ibm erschien, seien nur wenige Klagen über mangelhafte Wasserversorgung im Malvern Distrikt laut geworden. Es sei dadurch Abhilfe geschaffen worden, daß man den Wasserzufiuß teilweise ermäßigte, um in Malvern stärkeren Druck zu bekommen. Uebrigens werde man näch stens eine neue Röhrenleijung durch Fullarton, Frewville, Malvern und möglicher Weise auch Clarence Park legen. Wie der Abg. Solomon vom Minister für öffentliche Arbeiten erfuhr, sind für die Fertigstellung des Happy Val- -ley Reservoirs bis jetzt £271,274 verausgabt worden. Der ursprüngliche Kostenanschlag fei £237,726 gewesen. Abg. McDonald setzte die Besprechung der zur zweiten Lesung vorliegenden Womens Suffrage-BM fort. Abg. Landseer wünscht diese wichtige Frage durch das Referendum, die Volksabstimmung entschieden zu sehen. Er erklärte sich gegen das Prinzip; denn daß die Frau auch mora- lisch nicht über dem Manne stehe, bewiesen die Eheschei- scheidungsgerichte zur Genüge. Dazu komme, daß die Frau noch mehr leidenschaftliche Elemente in die Politik tragen würde und daß es nach ihrem Eintritt in die politische Arena um den Frieden im Hause wohl traurig stehen werde. Auch der Abg. Ri'vdoch widersetzte sich entschieden der Annahme der; Bill in ähnlichem Sinne sprach der Abg.E. W» Hawker. Wenn man die Frau in das Gebiet der Po- ""litik hineinzuziehen wünsche, so solle das allmählich geschehen. Von großer Wirkung war die längere, ebenfalls der Bill feindliche Rede des Herrn R. Homburg. Wenn die Herren Minister so viel Zutrauen zu einem Referendum hätten, wie sie vorgäben, weshalb thäten sie denn diesen die Frage mit einem Schlage entscheidenden Schritt nicht? Eben weil sie wüßten, daß sie jämmerlich geschlagen wer- den würden. In der Stadt selbst und den Vorstädten hat- .ten die Frauen ja gegen die Bill nichts einzuwenden, schon well ihnen ihre Stimmabgabe dort fö leicht gemacht werde. Aber wie stehe es mit den Landdistrikten, wo man Meilen- weit nach dem nächsten Wahlorte zu fahren habe. Die Stadtfrauen würden eben die Stimmen ihrer Schwestern vom Lande einfach ersticken. Falls die Bill ins Komitee gelangen follte, werde er ewige Nebenaniräge einzuschieben suchen, so auch einen, wonach die Frauen von Farmern, die eine oder zwei Meilen von dem Wahlorte entfernt wohnen, ihre Stimmen durch die Post adzugeden berechtigt fein sollen. Nachdem der Abg. Cätt zugunsten der Bill gesprochen, der Abg. Solomon dagegen noch einmal schweres Geschütz, gegen dieselbe aufgefahren. hatte, bestand die Bill mit 28 gegen 12 Stimmen die zweite Lesung. Für die Bill stimmten die Abg. Archibald, Batchelor, Wrooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Caldwell, Catt, Cock, Coney- beer, Foster, Gillen, Holder, Hooper, Hourigan, Howe, Jenkins, Kingston, Lake, McDonald, .MaeGillivräy, Me- Pherson, O'Loughlin, Poynton, Pttee, Randell, Schert, - Wood und Cockbmn. Gegen die Bill nahmen Stellung die Abg. Blacker, H. E. Downer, Grainger, Griffiths, Hague, H. W. Hawker, Johnson, Kelly, Landseer, MeLachlan, Mottle und Solomon. Nachdem die Railway Csmmifstoners.Bill we'jer be- sprechen worden war, erfolgte gegen 11% Uhr fte Ver tagung. j Mittwoch, 12. Dezember. Weitere Petitionen gegen die State Advances Bill wurden dem Hause vorgelegt. Der Abg. Grainger erfuhr vom Finanzminister, es sei soeben ein Uebereiu kommen zwischen der Regierung kund den Banken abgeschlossen worden. Die sich je nach Um- ständen hebenden oder sinkenden Zinsskala für RegierungZ- Depositen dürfen weder 3 Prozent übersteigen noch unter 2 Prozent fallen. Nach Aussage des Ministers für öffentliche Arbeiten rechnet die Eisenbahnbehörde infolge der Ermäßigung der Weizensrachtraten auf eine Einbuße von £5000 bis £6000. Andererseits würde jedoch voraussichtlich ein erheblich größeres Quantum als während des Vorjahrs, auf unseren Bahnen transportiert werden. Der Unterrichtsminister, Ehrenw. Dr. Cockbnrn, erklärte auf eine Frage des Abg. Batchelor, er werde für den Un- terricht der auf den Dorfniederlassnngen befindlichen schul- Pflichtigen Kinder Fürsorge tragen. Man erwäge gegen- wärtig, ob der Staat die Settler bei der Errichtung von Schulbauten unterstützen soll. Vom Oberhause lief die Standard Time Bill ein. Die Impounding Bill wurde zurückgezogen. Die Wages Attachment Abolition Bill, deren Zweck es ist, Arbeitern ihre erworbenen Löhne sicher zu stellen, wurde nach langer Debatte mit 23 gegen 19 Stimmen zur zweiten Lesung zugelassen. — Im Komitee fand die Bill ebenfalls ihre Erledigung und nach Aufhebung der Tagesordnung ging sie auch durch das letzte Stadium. Vom Oberhause lief die Nachricht ein, daß es der Conciliation Bill seine Zustimmung erteilt habe. Das Haus applaudierte. Es folgte eine längere Debatte über das bekannte An- suchen des Gesetzgebenden Rates betr. Beschaffung eines passenderen Sitzungssales. Die Debatte wurde in einer für das Oberhaus wenig schmeichelhaften oder auch nur rücksichtsvollen Weise geführt. Die beleidigenden Bemerk- ungen des Abg. Price wurden selbst von seinen im Ober- hause sitzenden Collegen ans's schärfste gerügt. Das Komitee, welches in dieser Angelegenheit mit dem Oberhause zu unterhandeln beauftragt wurde, setzt sich ans den Abg. Sir John Downer, Burgoyne, Grainger, Price und dem Minister für öffentliche Arbeiten zusammen. Den übrigen Teil der bis gegen 11% Uhr währenden Sitzung beanspruchte die Loan Bill. Donnerstag, 13. Dezember. Der Kronlandsminister gab dem Abg. Price die Ver sicherung, man werde, wenn irgend möglich, für die Beschaff- nng weiterer Arbeiterblöcke Sorge tragen. Die Pastoral Bill kam weiter zur Debatte und bestand mit 26 gegen 18 Stimmen die dritte Lesung, und eine lange Debatte über die Tsxation-BM folgte. Die Sitzung schloß erst gegen 3% Uhr am Freitag Morgen. Freitag, 14. Dezember. Der Finanzminister teilte dem Abg. Monte auf Befragen mit, die Regierung habe Staatsbonds im Betrage von £2000 an den neulich von seiner Stellung zurückgetretenen Chef des Zollamts, Mc. Sanderson, verkauft. Es habe dieser Herr seine Pension (£2000) in dieser Weise ausge- zahlt zu bekommen gewünscht. Der Premier erklärte in Entgegnung auf eine Frage des Abg. Grainger, er glaube nicht, daß die State Ad vances- und die Consolidated Stock Fund Bill in der lau fenden Session erledigt werden würde. Die Loan Bill kam weiter zur Debatte und ging durchs Komitee. Der Unterrichtsminister brachte die Rural Industries Bill zur zweiten Lesung ein. Die Standard Time Bill bestand die zweite und nach Aufhebung der Tagesordnung auch die dritte Lesung. Auch die Civil Service Amendment Bill wurde erledigt, und gegen 6 Uhr am Sonnabend Morgen vertagte sich das Haus auf die nächste Woche. Auf den Abgeordneten Price hat das Unter haus alle Ursache stolz zu sein. Er gehört zu jenen Cha- ratteren, die fest und unerschrocken, frei von der Leber weg sprechen und handeln, und die in einer verantwortlichen Stellung entweder die Welt ans der alten in neue und bessere Bahnen leiten oder -- sich unsterblich blamieren. Pries's Stärke scheint die letzters Kapazität zu fein. Die Debaitierung des Ansuchens der Oberen Kammer, ihr den früheren Unterhaussaa! zum Sitzungszimmer zu überlassen, benutzte dieser preisliche Vertreter von Sturt, der seine politischen Gänseflügel für Schwanenschwwgen zu halten scheint, zu einem stech beleidigenden Ausfall gegen das Oberhaus. Dr. Magarcy hatte bekanntlich den Vorschlag gemacht, den gewünschten Raum einfach in Besitz zu nch- men. „Aber laß sie nur mal kommen,"" meinte Price, „wir wollen den Herren schon heimleuchten. Wenn sie unser kühles, gesundes Sitzungszimmer zu benutzen wünschen, dann laß sie ihre Beratungen darin abhalten, wenn wir nicht da sind, Montags, Freitags. Sonnabends oder vielleicht auch Sonntags. Da klagten die Herren Senatoren über Mangel an frischer Luft in ihrem Lokal und schlechte Ventilation. Wüßten sie denn nicht, daß . sich im Erdgeschoß ihres Ge bäudes herrliche Räumlichkeiten befinden, die ursprünglich für Weinkeller bestimmt, grade dieserhalö den Oberhäuslern vortrefflich paffen sollten. Man höre ja häufig, daß ein vierräumiges Miethaus zu ihrer Unterbringung genüge."" Seinen Haupttrumpf spielte Mr. Price jedoch mit den Wor- Leu aus: „Die Idee, Geld für den Gesetzgebenden Rat ans- zugeben, wenn es in der Unley Schule noch an Raum mangelt !"" — Da also lag der Hund begraben. Um sich auf billige Weise einigen seiner Wähler gefällig zu zeigen, hält er es nicht für unter seiner Würde, Leute, die hoch über ihm stehen, in gemeiner feiger Weise anzugreifen und mit Schmutz zu bewerfen. Wohin ein solches verächtliches Strebertum führt, wird im Laufe der Zeit auch Mr. Price wohl an sich selbst erfahren.

36,53658083,"The Register. ADELAIDE: TUESDAY, DEC. 18, 1894. THE WOMAN'S FRANCHISE BILL.",Article,"South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)",18-12-1894,Article,3088,"The Register Adelaide : Tuesday, Dec. 18, 1894. THE WOMAN'S FRANCHISE BILL. Amongst ths chief public events of Monday were two discussions by separate bodies of controversialists concerning the female franchise question. One of these took place in the Assembly Chamber, and the other outside of it. Ultimately, however, the two gatherings practically merged themselves into one in Parliament Buildings. The engagement which we have in courtesy termed the outside one served for a double purpose. The audience welcomed that talented and meritorious woman, Miss Spence, on her return from a pro longed pilgrimage in other lands. They also met with the object of giving an ini petus to the advance of the legislation for which the Woman's Suffrage League has worked so arduously. And we are bound to add that the speeches made by the women on that occasion were the most sensible. Said one masculine talker, alluding to Miss Spence, 'The woman in her was lost in the cause' which she espoused. As a matter of fact the true woman is glorified by her promotion of social reforms. The remark was at best a left-handed compliment to Miss Spance, and the opponents of female franchise are certain to seize upon it as strong argument in tbe service of their side. If we are through its agency to lose all out women, and to get so many petticoated politicians in exchange for them, the gift of female franchise will be an exceedingly bad bargain for the country. But we reject the conclusion. The observation referred to was of the kind classified by a fashionable humourist in the category of 'Things one would rather have left unsaid.' The same speakers however, uttered another remark more significant and objectionable than the first. 'If all those present go to the House this evening they will in timidate members to vote in favour of the Women's Franchise Bill.' Jusfc before the lady President had said — 'Some, of them' had been at the House nearly all the after noon listening to the debates, and they wore going there after the meeting to await the ultimate decision, if they had to wait all night.' Here again the adver saries of the franchise reform have been given great occasion for cynicism. 'If so many scores of women,' they will say, 'can absent themselves from their family circles day and night in the mere hope of seeing Parliament grant to them their rights of citizenship, what stories of deserted hearths shall we not hear when women are transformed into active politicians ?' And it is not surprising that, when the ladies' meet ing trooped down to Parliament House late at night with the purpose of 'intimidating' legislators, a particularly crusty member should have been half tempted to clear the Chamber by calling attention to tbe presence of strangers. But he did not do so. He was afraid to do it, and he was not the only member affected by the perspective bounded by the Gallery pillars. But Dr. Cockburn, whose pilotage of the measure the picturesque company of the softer - hearted sex were watching, was moved by the fascinating spectacle to the remotest depths of his romantic soul. The con sciousness that he was on the popular side induced him to redouble his zeal in rushing on 'the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill.' And, not being embarrassed with a memory too ser viceable, he did this forgetful of what he had said a few months before in the same House, when advocating a similar measure, containing, however, an impor tant qualification in the shape of a refe rendum clause. ' 'It is well,' he urged, ' for the people to have an opportunity of pronouncing an opinion as to exactly what they want done in the matter.' There was, therefore, a provision for the refe rence of tbe subject to tbe electors . . . . The referendum was a proper provision to intro duce into a Bill which contemplated a great constitutional change. ... In all grave changes they should say to the people— 'This is your Constitution. We aro only tho re pository of your privileges. As your representatives, is it your pleasure that we should make any grave change in your Consti tution ':' These observations were uttered whilst the echoes of the general election con tests resounded through tho country. This year, however, the task required of the Minister is to practically argue against his eloquently expressed sentiments of a year ago, and Dr. Cockburn's flexibility is, of course, equal to the demand made upon it. Still he is by no means alone in his somersault turning; and, after all, the principle involved in tho Bill is not affected by tho inconsistencies of politicians. The Assembly acted rightly last night in rejecting proposed amendments dis tinguishing between various classes of women. So long as a man votes because he is a man, so long should a woman vote because she is a woman. this is the crux of the whole matter. Even the protest made against the enfranchisement of the street nymph is inconsistent whilst the right of rating ia possessed by the men who support the Magdalen. Yet there is some reason why the peculiar liabilities of her sex should entitle all woman to the special use of the Absent Voters Act— since there is an Absent Voters Act— which nras resolved upon last night at the instance of Mr Hague and Sir John Downer. We fear, however, that the adroit modification appended by the Ministry will almost neutralize the amend ment introduced earlier into the Bill. However, for good or for ill, South Australia seems now pretty certain to be committed to the female franchise. We believe that it will be for good, though it would have been well — the Bill having been kept back so long not to have pressed it to the delayign of more urgent public busi ness. The wonder is that the woman's suffrage propaganda should not be sup ported here, as it is in England, by the Conservative party; The probability is that women will prove to be conserva tive in the best sense, and that ten years hence, if the occasion should arise, the votes given yesterday on the Bill will be reversed. The immediate effect of the passing of the measure— if the law be not altered in other respects will be to give a new advantage to proporty-holders in the shape of an ex tended franchise for the Upper House under conditions explained recently by Mr. Boothby. Regarding the ultimate result there is warrant for fresh hope rather than for increased apprehension, especially as the education of women has advanced so remarkably. The present franchise is responsible for the ex ceedingly unsatisfactory condition of Par liament. Can a worse thing follow from its extension ? Taxation in Victoria. — As a New Year's gift to the nation it is evident that Sir Frederick Sargood considers that an income tax on the very heavy scale proposed by Mr. Turner is somewhat out of place. When Sir Robert Peel first imposed such a tax in England Thomas Hood quaintly expressed the sort of feeling evoked by alluding to the sweet sounds of the New Year's bells in the old days of light taxation, and went on to say — But ah ! ranch sadder now I feel to hear tha* old melodious chime Recalling only how a Peel has taxed tbe comings in of time. The principle upon which the Turner Ministry proceeds in adjusting the new policy of taxation on land and income seems to bo that whatever shortage is brought about by the adoption of amend ments in the first part of the scheme must forthwith be made up by additions to ? the second part. Thus, when the land exemption was increased iroin £100 to £500, and a serious deficiency - was thus threatened, the proposed rates of income tax were at once increased to 4d., 6d., and Sd. in the pound. Later on, when it was moved and acarried against the Government that tha old land tax should be remitted as rroin tne nrst or July last, Mr. Tumor explained that this step would involve a loss of £60:000, and that the decision would either have to be reversed or he wauld have to bring in a further taxation proposal, presumably upou similar lines. The BUI is now through Committee, but a fj-p?h complication has arisen in the slur j of a serious difference of opinion in Cabinet owing to the concessions made by the Premier in order to secure the progress of the measure up to its present stage. Sir Frederick Sargood, the Minister for Defonco, has resigned, and one ochor Minister has followed his example. Tha real fact of tho matter is that tho . Premier is quite impo tent to control the business of the Assembly, and therefore un able to keep hi3 promises. When he undertook that the machinory clauses'-' of the Taxation Bill should bo sent up to tho Legislative Council separately, so as to five the latter bouy a voice in tho settlement of the question, he did not reckon with the fact that Mr. Shiels had enlisted the feeling of the Assembly aj/aiust any such concession. Like a henpecked husband, who, in \ moment of confidence, has ventured :o promise what his wife would and nrould not do, the Premier very ioon had reason to repent of his tome city ; the outcome being was that he 'asceptsd the feeling of tho House,' |udt, of course, as the husband has to do n similar circumstances. The £500 ex ?mption certainly spoils the simplicity of he land tax. Doubtless it has been igreed tu chiefly in the interests of the itruggling farmer, who is so heavily )(jpressed with the existiug fiscal jurdens ; but surely it would be a very nuch wiser policy to relieve him of 6ome )f these burdens instead of giving him he benefit of an exemption which will Jso relieva hundreds of persons, such as he owners of Euburban villas, who can tfford to pay the tax, but who, under so arge ab exemption on the bare unim proved value of the land, will fo entire]/ froo. On the other bead there »re mauy persons who hare put all their energies into developing tbe iodustriei oE the colony, who will now eeriomlv rec insider whether it is well lot them to remain any longer in a country where they aro bo heavily handicapped If taxation as they seem likely to be in the future. The recent cudden drop in the price of Victorian stock shows how sensitively responsive the SBoaej market; is to the financial difliculties of tho colony, and until there are distin ci; evidences of a firm national de* terminat'on tu discountenance party wrangling and to courageously take up the burden that has to be bone, the without unfairness or party wrangling, tbe same uneasiness is bound to continue, both in England and Australia; The City Council.— The sesr Coaaoil ffM in a (juiesr.f-nt mood on Monday eiterBOM.

If all the Gtcaniers of the line carried as tuauy passengers on each j trip at> the Himalaya did this time Sir Thomas \ Sutherland (chairman of the P. & O. Com-! pany) would have litlle cause to complain of I blackening jiatrouage as he did recently. This highly popular steamer left London with about 500 ealoon pas^ngeiii, and although a large number were dropped tin route she still had on buanl marly 300 wlu-n slie arrived here. AU but 41, who joiued the steamer at Albany, were through passengers. Only 35 lauded heiv, there being no uverhuid nu.il train to induce persons booked for the eastern ookiiiieo to come ashore, and only the Adelaide mails were landed. The Hon. N. Fitzgerald, who wa£ met at the anchorage by Colonel Gordon, wab a patjsenger by the steamer, as was aL>o I Mr. J. L. Lloyd, official assignee of New South Wales, who had been on a holiday to Kurope. Sir. William Shierlaw and his son (Mr. S. Shierlaw) returned to the colony by the vessel after a trip extending over eight and a half j months. The R.M.S. Australia, of the same! line, will reach Largs Bay from Melbourne/ this morning, and will tail for London at noon on Wednesday. Saturday being the last day of the present term, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court on Thursday Mr. G. Ash, M.P., was on Saturday morning admitted as a practitioner of tfce Supreme Court by his Honor the Chief Justice. A number of members of the bar and others were present, and after Mr. Ash had signed the roll he was heartily congratulated by them. One of the private individuals stepped forward when Mr. Ash had received the congratula tions of his brother (solicitors and handed him some papers, together with a cheque as re taining fee. It is (juestionable whether any practitioner was ever before engaged so soon after his admission. . It is announced else whera that the Hon. C. C. Kingston and Mr. Ash have entered into partnership as solicitors, and that the firm will practise as Kingston and Ash. Mr. Adi is the first student who has obtained the LL.B. degree at the Adelaide University under the new regulations. Canon Carter, Diocesan Missioned of Trurq, England, arrived by the ilelboume express on Saturday morning. He was met at the rail way-station by the Dean, Sir. Sturcke, the Sheriff, and Mr. Morgan Hawkes. Tbeiev. gentleman, who was here a short time back with the Bey. A. W. Kobinson, preached at Christ Church, North Adelaide, on Sunday morning and at Port Adelaide in the evening. Since his arrival from England he has been laid up with typhoid ferer in Tasmania, which greatly interfered with the work he intended doing. To-day and to-morrow he will ""hold a quiet day"" for churchworkers at the Cathe dral. An inspection of gardens*in the districts of Kent Town and Norwood by Mr. George Quian, the inspector under the Vine sand Kruit Protection Act^ has shown that' 304 gardens containing 89G trees are infected with the codlin moth. The gardens, which are nearly all attached to residences, are infected worse than in any other locality the inspector has visited, but the fruit is generally grown for private use aad not for the market. ""I am disposed to think,"" remarks the inspector in his report,"" 1 that the regulations will require to be very ttricUy enforced before any ap preciable diminution of the pest will be notice able, as the trees in many cases are utterly ntgiectod aud the occupiers extremely care less/ Mr. yuinn directs attention to the re sults up to the present of the spraying carried out in Mr. Xiteckke's garden at Hackney for the destruction of the moth. The trees have received two spuyings since the fruit was the size of marbles, and they are now laden with half-grown fruit, quite 93 per cent, of which was perfectly free up to December 11, while a few other trees cot treated wero badly affected- A groat deal of fruit, according to Mr. Quinn, has been already destroyed by the larvae and ravages, of pear scab (fnaada dium) and he thinks another spraying will be required. In these days it is more than difficult to devise new methods of extracting money from the public for charitable or any other pur poses. It has remained, however, for die ladies of Adelaide who are working in connec tion with the Village Settlements' Aid Society to apply a method new to this city, although fairly well tested in others. Following the example of cities in which ** Hospital Satur day*1 is recognised as a permanent institution, the ladits here determined to organise a public collection in the principal thoroughfares on Saturday last. Citizens were thoroughly warned of this attempt upon their pockets by public advertisement; it did not come upon them, therefore, with a great shock when they found fifteen of the principal positions in the thoroughfares taken possession of by two or three ladies at a time, from midday until 6 in the evening, aad in some cases until 9.30, in tent upon getting all the money that they could from passers-by. In addition to these stations in town there was also one at GleneJg, and the total result of the self-denying efforts of the ladius is the—in these times—fairly satisfactory sum of rather more than £60. When the funds that are expected from all sources are received it is hoped to make a very substantial Christmas gift to all the settle ments. H.M.S. Orlando was towed to Sutherland dock, Sydney, on Monday last for an overhaul The Dart and Karakatta hare returned to Sydney from the New Hebrides. The former been employed surveying the coast of Ambryn, Mallioollo, and other parts of the group for the past four months. It was the Dart that sent the first ac counts of tiro Ambryn earthquakes and vol canic outbreak; and an officer referring to the wonderful body of lava that ran oat of the cr&Mr baid it altogether eclipsed the Etna eruption of a few yean back. An officer of the Karahitta, which hie also visited Ambryn, reports that a new volcano to the north of -the old one broke out about the beginning of last month and remained active. The mountain is about 2,000 ft. high, and the crater about GOO ft. deep. A streun of lava burst forth from the side of the mountain and shot across a valley, a distance of 500 yards. It then ran a distance of 15 miles down the hills to the sea, and in its passage devastated several villages, killing six natives aad numberless pigs. The contact of the lava with the eea caused a vast column of steam to rise in the air to a height o£ 4,500 ft, the altitude being taken with a sextant by the officers of the Dart. The ashes from the volcano covered the decks of the vessels to a thickness of twveral inches, and inada matters par ticularly unpleasant. The Wallaroo remains at Samoa for some time. The Royalist spends Christmas at Lytteltou. The Ring dove is at Auckland, and her sister chip, the Goldfinch, is at Port Adelaide. The Kara katta will sail from Sydney for Melbourne to-morrow. TheTauranga, Ka.toomraL.Mili'nra, Lizard, Boomerang, and Rapid are in Port Jackson. Cables were received in Sydney from Auckland bust week announcing the arrival of the German cruiser Bussard at that purt from Samoa. The Bussard left Apia un December 1, being relieved on that date by thoFalke, which arrived from Sydney. The Bussard met with very heavy weather on the passage to Auckland, during which the main mast was damaged, the vessel being hove-to for 24 hours for repairs. The bad weather lasted six days. The future movements of the Bussard sre uncertain. The attendance on Saturday at the first test match now being played in Sydney between Mr. Stoidart's team and an Australian Eleven was over 26,000. -'This,"" states our Sydney correspondent, ""is the best on record for the Sydney Cricket Ground, aud probably means that last Saturday saw the largest crowd that ever gathered at si cricket match in this country."" The Australian score of 586 is the largest that has ever been made in a test match, and Gregory's contribution of 201 is the largest individual total that has been compiled in any such contest. As a testimonial for his prowess Gregory, at the close of the play on Saturday, was presented by the Premier of Xew South Wales, as r-jiairman of tbo local Cricketing Association, with £103 10s., which was col lected oil the ground. For some time the West Torrens Friendly Societies' Council has been couadering the advisability of establishing a dispensary, and has issued a report in which it is stated that information has been received from the Bendigo United Friendly Societies* Medical Institute and Dispensary, which commenced in 1574 with 855 members, and in October 1890 the membership had increased to 2,440. The Bum per member per annum is 16s. for doctor and medicine, as against Us. 6d. per member paid here. Notwithstanding this small amount paid annually for doctor and medicine, the Bendigo Dispensary has paid off a property valued at £2,750 without any extra chaise, and the net assets, have accumulated to £4,0*8 Ss. lid. Medical institutes and dispensaries in connec tion with friendly societies date as far back as 1&)(5, and from iuioiiualioa given it would seem that the same causes prompted the societies in Great Britain to form medical institutes and dispensaries as are now put for ward by the council, i.e., the great difference in the treatment giveit by the medical men and chemists to lodge patients and private patients. There are now about 60 institutes and dispen saries in active operation in Great Britain with a membership of over a quarter of a million, and embracing nearly 1,300 societies, 22 of these having buildings of their own. One of these, the Leamington Association, not withstanding a heavy year's sickness and the cost of renovating their buildings, show a profit of £120 10a. for the year. Should the proposal meet with the support of die lodges it is intended to engage the services of two first class medical men, to be elected by delegates from the societies at a fixed salary, to attend to the members and their family These doctors would be required to give the whole of their time to lodge patients, no private prac tice being allowed, and the members would then be in a position of having a private doctor and medicine for a less sum than at present charged, and save at least lls. Sd. per member per annum to the in?.n«g?? mi . lir fund. The medical men being employes of the societies it would be their duty to conserve the interests of the societies in every passible way. One of the well-known phases of a bushman'e life is his experience when, after working for twelve months, he gets his holiday and his cheque and proceeds to town to spend his hard earned wages. An instance of the rapidity wid? which the spending can be done came before the Adelaide Police Court on Saturday morn ing, -when Ellen Guy, alias Broderick. was charged before Mr. J. Gordon, S.M., with robbing John Martin of a banknote for £10. The informant^ wno appeared in court in a very A**eA condition, said - *3«* defendant met him in the etteet and asked him to have a drink. :Ha took her into the Bedford ijotel and into a room offtheLar where there were two other women.

Ou Thursday morning the daily papers reported of the House ofj Assembly: "" The House was sti 1 sitting when we went to press."" On Friday, again, the same sentence appeared. Altogether, 43 hours were spent by conscientious hon. members in the Legislative Hall last week. After all this sitting one might expect the House to hatch something in the way of Bills, but the record this year is likely to be as low as that of most sessions. "" Work, work, work"" cried tlie poor victim of the sweating sys tem as applied to shirtmaking •, ""talk J-illc, talk"" is ihe doleful refraiu of the wonuout member of Parliament. And the talk goes on in one weak, washy, nvrrlnsling flood, while the long suftVi-ing Hansard reporter sits silent ;ihoVt\ J t is an annua! occurrence. During j tl.o youtli of the session, when thej lifebioud flows freely through the viens, the light-hearted legislature airs his eloquence on tlie fads of; Caldwell and other soft-hearted senti- | mentalists who wish to abolish capital punishment. Little reck they that time passe3, aud the session will not always be young, until December comes, and they realise that age is upon them aud they must die. Then^ in the agony, of desire to accomplish something e'er olirion passes over them, they scamp through work that ought to be gone over deliberately and well. If the chief sinners in. this matter wero new members one would not be surprised. Naturally, we would think, they wish to show their con stituents that they do some work to earn their salaries, and they imagine that they were sent their to talk. But the chief culprits are net new members, but men who hare seen the same thing repeated year after year, and who by this time should have learned the folly of wasting time. Honour to whom honour is due—let us say that the members for Wallaroo are not among the offenders. The one is worthy of his title—the silent member; the other, as a rule, when he speaks has something to say. It would be a good thing for the country if the electors, when again called upon to make their choice, were to search the columns of Hansard, and having found the men who -occupy most space there, were to relegate them to a sphere where ""they can waste nc more printers' ink. And may we suggest to the Literature Committee of the W.C.T.TT. that it' would uot be a bad thing to circulate among members at the beginning of the - session that hymn of Sankey's that begins: "" Work, for the night is coming."" . Cathouc Congest.—In .another column will be found a notice of a concert to be given this evening fejr the children attending the Catholic School, Radios.

Ministeeiaii Association. — The monthly meeting of the abore association was held at the Wesleyan Parsonage, Moontn, on Monday, presided over by the Be*. J. D. Langsford. A very interesting and instruc tive paper was read by the Bev. W. Tnseie, of Wallaroo, on the subjeot of "" The materi alistic tendencies of the age."" After shoving the wide SDread of the material listic spirit in general, the writer proceeded to set out the inrrease of this tendency in eociety in moral* and in religion, and concluded hy drawing attention to some of the utilities in present day materialism, but warning against the danger of extreme. A very spirited <uid useful discussion follows J, in which the Berg, A. J. Burt, O. Like, J. Tiller, T. Allan, X. Perry, and A. Hodge took part. It was decided to accept an invitation from the Be*.

A vote of £5 was granted for several cases of argent need. The money in some cases was given, and in other it was to be expended by a Committee as required after proper enquiry. One case of special interest was considered although the actual recipent was beyond tbe Society's limit, nnd it wa# resolved that the case be recommend to some local organization. It was reported that the Choral Soc'eiy indended giving a choral service on Tu :sdaj, December 25 (Christmas D<iy), in the morning and evening. The collections in the morning will bo in aid of the funds of the Benevolent Society, and in the evening on behalf of the Institute.

This is a natural d sire, but the question his still to be answered can the ore be treated locally as advantageously ai at Wal'aroi where such facil;ties are available for tbe satisfactory trea'ment of this class of ore ? How Laboub has to Pat.—A story given on good authority was told a few days ago by a gentlemen from the North as illustrating the heading of this paragraph. A professional gentleman had employed for eleven years, as gardner, a nan who was a great agitator for violent changes so far as they affected the rich and whose tongue was always on the wag like all pretended advanced reformers, denoun cing everything under the son and demanding by legislative enactment the settlement of every dispute great and small between em ployer nnd employee. All laws according to the agitating gardner were made for the en. riohing of'the wealthy and the impoverishing of the poor and it therefore teodoio necessary to frame legislation to upset the existing order of things. The poor gardner little dreamt of the consequences which his advo cacy of violent changes would have on his position and interests. Though certain legis lative enactments his employer was called npon to bear additional taxation equal to £24 per annum. The employer to meet this tax, bad only two alternatives left him, either to reduce the gardner'* wages or discharge bim. He acquainted the gardner of the posit ij;i tell -iag him, that he, tbe gardner, should in future be satisfied with 20s a week instead of 30s, or leave, assuring him at the same time that if lie left, no other man would be employed. The 20s was acoepted ani thus the gardner pare tbe additional taxation which his un wise advocacy and wild agitaiion - helped to enforce npon his employer. Death of Mb £. J. Hibcock.—The sad n -ws of the death of Mr E. J. Hiacock at Alberton on Sunday morning last, at the early age of 26 years, oast a gloom over Wallaroo and tbe surrounding districts. Four years ago Mr Hiecock resided at Wallaroo, where be was first assistant at tbe Poblio SohooL He was identified with orioket 8nd football there, and his unassum ing manner won for him a large number of f ienriB and admirers. He left Wallaroo for Adelaide, and shortly after resigned bis posiuon as school teacher, after which be acted in the capacity of Seoretary to tbe Single Tax League. Subsequently he con ducted the Pioneer, a Single Tax advocate, and later on joined Mr J. Med way Day at the office of the Voice (now defunct), succeed* that gentleman as Editor on his departure for Sydney. He was an avowed Single taxi r, a supporter of-Woman's Suffrage, and wa« generally recognised as an advocate in tbe interests of labour. He was also well known as an enthusiast in the cricke'-field, and was a member of two intercolonial teams, playing wiih the Adelaide olob on the Oval. Saturday w<ek, while playing cricket, be was struck in the abdomen with a cricket ball. Indentation of the bowels, accelerated by a quantity of cherries which th« deeeased ted eitjn, supervened and although, every effort medical skill could suggest to save him was used, he ■ eank and died.

Both Houses of Parliament sat on Tuesday, the Assembly starting at 10.30 in the morning and the Counoil at 2 o'olook in the afternoon. The form eft sat till eleven minates past and the latter till after half-past 11 at night. Both Houses sit this morning, the Council at 10.30 and the Assembly at 11 o'olock. Private members' business will have preoedenon. The order of Government business in the Assembly is :—Faotories, Friendly Societies, Railway Commissioners, Land, and Rural Industries Bills. FRIENDLY SOCIETIES BILL. The Legislative Councillors, who irately took business ont of the hands of the Government last Friday, met at 2 o'olock on Tuesday prepared to do their share to out the finishing touches to an unsatisfactory session. The Friendly Societies Bill was quickly slipped through its remaining stages, with the addition of a proviso to olause 3 to give Societies which have not hitherto kept the aocountg of different funds separate twelve months more in which to do so. This waa proposed by the Hon. R. S. Guthrie at the behest of Friendly Societies. The second reading of the Bill in the Assembly will be moved to-day. PASTORAL BILL. The long-expected Pastoral Bill came up from the Assembly, and the Standing Orders were suspended so that the Chief Secretary might move the second reading. This he did in half an hour, explaining concisely the main provisions of the measure. Every clause, nay, every line, was a concession to the pastoral industry and a liberalization of the present law. He was prepared to hear that too many restrictions were imposed. But half a loaf was better than no bread. "" This is not half a loaf,"" quoth tl>6 Hon. J. J. Duncan, and the Hon. J. Warren, ""It is not even a crust."" The Chief Secretary—"" It is a very good meal any., way. Every olause is a oonoession."" The Hon. J. L. Stirling—"" With nasty provisoes added."" Immediately theChief Secretary sat do »n the Hon. J. L. Stirling secured the adjournment of the debate till next day. TAXATION BILL. Now oame a lion in the path of peaoe—the message from the Assemblv dealing with the Taxation Bill—notifying its refusal to consider the one which proposed to exempt mortgages from taxation. The President immediately made a short statement, the gist of whioh was that the Council had always contended and still contended that it had the right to make amendmants in money Bills in the ordinary manner, and had only allowed suoh right to remain in abeyanoe so long as the compact of 1857 was adhered to. Consideration of the message was postponed until the evening, so that it and (he President's statement might be printed. The Lords of South Australia were given fifty-five minates to fortify themselves to eettleanimportantoonstitutional point. Before this was taokled other comparatively minor points of difference had to be discussed. The first related to the definition of an ""absentee,"" and the Chief Secretary set the ball rolling by asking the Counoil not to insist upon changing ""South Australia"" to "" Australasia."" The Government bad communicated with the Premier of New South Wales, who said his Government intended to draw the absentee line at the boundary of the colony. Before any further advance was made the Chairman wisely pointed ont to members that this was the final stage of the Bill. There could be no oonfer&nces. If the Council did not give way on every point the Bill would be lost. The Hon. K. Ward—""I deny the position."" The Chief Secretary regretted the position, and would like to see theoompaot of 1857 amended, but that could not be done now. tie appealed to those who believed in the broad principle of the Bill to support hiin. The Hon. Dr. Magarey set up the standard of "" Australia for the Australians"" ooupled with "" Australians for Australia,"" and of course supported the amendment of the Council. The Hons. A. A. Eirkpatrick and D. M. Charleston would give way on the point for the sake of the Bill, but Sir E. T. Smith would not support a mean, oonteinptible clause. The Hon. E. Ward'thought this ooutd not be the final stage, as the Assembly had not finally dealt with the Council's suggestions. Besides the opinion expressed by the President would not hold good unless the Assembly had disagreed with all the suggestions of the Council. The Hon. J. V. O'Loghlin quoted from "" Blaokmore"" to quash Mr. Ward's contention. The Hon. J. L. Stirling urged members, ^ome weal oome woe, to stiok by their amendments. The Chief Secretary—""And ruin the BilL"" The Hon. J. L. Stirling described expediency as the Iooking-glans into which members were more and more inclined to look when transacting public business. Members should' not put nails in the coffins of their privileges by abandoning their views. The Chief Secretary pointed ont that all the eloquent pathetio speeches and mixed metaphors came from opponents of the Bill. It was decided not to insist upon the amendment by the following vote:— ATLS, 9—Hons. Sir E. T. Smith F. Basedow, J. Darling, 3. S. Duncan, H. B_ Fuller, J. L. -stirling, E. Ward, J. Warren, and Dr. Magarev (teller). Nobs, li—Hons. H. Adams. J. G. Bice, D. M. Charleston, K. S. Guthrie, W. Has am. X. A. Eirkpatrick, G. McGregor, J. V. O'boihiio, W. A. Kobinson, W. Knssell, and Chief Secretary (teller). Majority of 2 for the Noes. PAUS. —Ays—Hon. A B. Addison. No—Hon. J. ^Martin. ^Jow oame another point. Should the disagreement of the Assembly as to the definition of "" mortgagee"" be considered at once or postponed until after the knotty point aoout the main question, which the Assembly refused to deal with, had been oonsidered ? The Ohief Secretary asked for immediate consideration, and, as a preparation for the coming storm, Tead the following carefuliy worded statement of Government polioy and promise: — ""In view of legislation in New Zealand there is muoh to be said in favour of the proposition to transfer a fair proportion of liability to land tax from the mortgagor to the mortgagee. The Government will endeavour during recess to formulate a proposal on the subject, and hope to be able to introduce a short Bill whioh will commend itself to Parliament early next session."" Thi* promise satisfied the Hon. J. V. O'Loghlin, who was the original mover in favour of exempting mortgagees. In no way could he help them now, as if, his amendment were insisted upon, the Bill would be lost. The Hon. Or. Magarey claimed that if the Bill was thrown out the Government would have immediately to find soine other means of raising taxation. Perhaps they would go for an all-round increase. The amendment was not insisted upon. On the question as to whether the Bill should be limited in its operation to two years, the Hon. E. Ward angt the Hon. Or. Magarey ridiculed the reason given by the Assembly for not agreeing with the amendment. By refusing to allow theeleotors at the next eleo'<ion to consider the matter the members of the Lower House showed that they were afraid to do so. The Hons. J. Warren and J. J. Duncan regretted that the Assembly and the Government had not the courage of their opinions. The following division gave the Chief Seoretary a majority of two:— Ayes, 8—Hons. F. Basedow, J. Darling, H. R. Fuller, Dr. Magare;t J- L. Stirling, E. Ward, J. Warren, and J. Duncan (teller). NOES, 10— Hons. H. Adams, D. M. Cnarlaston, B. S. Guthrie, W. Haslam, A. A. Kirfcpatrick. j G. McGregor, J. V. O'l.oghlin. W. A itobiuson, W. Russell, and Chief Secretarv (teller). PAIRS.-Ayes-Sir E. T. Smith, and Hon. J. Martin. Noes—Hons. A B. Addison, and J, u. Bice. The amendment defining ""unimproved value"" was not given away without kicks from Mr. Ward, Dr. Magarey, and Mr. Duncan. Mr. Danoan thought the Government might have accepted it. It was doubttul whether existing legislation did not cover the point, and a oase was likely to be tried to settle it. The carrying of the amendment would have prevented past taxation being interfered with. By 10 to 8 it was resolved not to insist. Now oame ""suggestion No. 10,"" dealing with the exemption of mortgages, and the question whether, in refusing to oonsider it, the Assembly had broken the spirit of the compact of 1857. The Hon. J. L. Stirling wished to move a general motion expressing regret that the Assembly would not consider the suggestion, the motion to be sent iu the form of a message to the Lower House, but the Prebidenc ruled that such a motion could ouly be moved in the whole Council. Mr. Stirling, continuing his argument, said Che. Council bad equal power to legislate on money Bills except as to introducing them. The Assembly had put too limited an interpretation upon the compact. They should have either assented to or disagreed from every suggestion. The words of the compact of 2S57 should hare been paramount over the Standing Orders of the Assembly. The Council should stand on its rights. He moved the postponement if the amendment, so that at the proper time the message he wished sunt to the Assembly might be put. The amendment: should be sent back to the Assembly. The Hon. J. V. O'Loghlin agreed that trie rights and privileges of (be Council should be held, but if the Council went out of its way to cause points of differenoe they would not uphold their privileges. The Hon. Dr. Magarey thought the Assembly had got into a jumble, for whioh there was no need, beoause they might if they wanted tQ-liave negatived the Bill. The Counoil should not be bound by the compact if the Assembly did not stick to it. The Chief Seoretary characterized this as a constitutional storm in a teapot. The Assembly had met the Counoil courteously and graciously, aud might have met them in a very different way. Under the question of the definirion of ""mortgagee,"" the whole question was oonsidered by the Assembly, and they said they coald not agree with it. The Assembly bad sent a courteous message, and the Council ahould not go behind that message to asoertain what was done. The message oontaiued no infringement of the compact, as it said some suggestions were accepted and others rejected. To tiod any flaw in cbe action of the Assembly they had to go behind the message, and look at an early print of the records, whioh might be altered. It was preposterous for the Counoil to make a fuss, as tne Assembly oould not go back on its own solemn message, according to whioh 'it had considered the Council's suggestion. Mr. Stirling wanted to reply, bat the Hon. F. Basedow at 11.15 applied tbe closure. By 8 to 6 the Committee decided not to Dostpjne consideration. Then tbe Hon. E. Ward a-sked the Chairman for a Presidential ruling as to whether tile Assembly had violated the famous compact. The Chairman said earlier in the day he had expressed the opinion that the Assembly should oonsider the suggestion, lnferentiallv the message from tile Speaker said they had ; the records said not. Which was right he was not prepared to say. Mr. Ward—But they give reasons for not considering the suggestion. The Chairman—The reasons have nothing to do with it. The message says the Assembly would not acoept the (-uggestion. By 8 to 6 the Committee agreed not to insist upon its amendment. The last amendment was not insisted upon. Thus the Counoil gave way on every point, aud the Bill is ready for the Governor's signature. FACrOEIKS bill! The Factories Bill in^oage was next considered. The Chief Secretary asked the Counoil not to insist upon increasing the limit of overtime from fifty to 100 hours. Astern tight ensued with the old battle cry between town and oountry. The Labour members, led by the Hou. D. M Charleston, thought that in these d*ys when so many people could not find work overtime should be discountenanced. The <;.mntry representatives, with the Hons. 1£. Ward and W. Haslam in the van, contended that it would be most inconvenient to limit the overtime as proposed. Mr. Charleston finally admitted chat the oountry had claims, but he pleaded for sympathy for city workers. By 12 to 10 the Counoil deoided to insist up in its amendment. It was also resolved to insist, on grounds of delicacy, upon striking out Clause 16, whioh says a woman shall not be employed in a factory within a month after ouuiinemmit. The Labour party were divided as to whether the provision for ohildren under thirteen working in factories by special permission should be insisted upon. Mr. Cnarleston thought they would be better working under restraint in a properly ventilated factory than running about the streets. The amendment was insisted upon. An even division was taken as to whether the Counoil should insist on striking ont olause 25, aud the President oasced with the Ayes, ""to uphold a former decision of the Counoil."" Tbe Assembly will oonsider the Council's message to-day. OI7IL SEUVICB BILL. The Civil Service Amendment Bill was received from the Assembly and taken charge of by the Hou. J. V. O'Loghlin, who will move the second reading to day. ELECTORAL BILL LOST. Owing to thesadden adjournmenton Friday the Hjlejtoral Bill slipped off the paper and the Caief Secretary moved the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable him to restore it. There were several objecting voices, whs considered it waste time to bjther about the measure thus late in the session, but the Chief Seoretary explained that he wanted it restored so that next session it might be taken up under the Lapsed Bills Continuance Bill. There were 12 Ayes aud 10 No-as, aud inas£ muoh as an absolute majority of the Couuoil was required to deali with this, a constitutional question, the Bitlfe:l into the abyss of obscurity. the Chief Secretary was annoyed, and audibly accused more than one member, whom he had asked to "" favour"" him of shabbiness. LICENSED VICTUALLERS BILL. The Opposition, flushed -by suocess, tried, on tbe motion of the Hon. IS. Ward—"" That the Chairman do now leave the ohair""—to massacre the Licensed Victuallers Bill. The following division was taken :— AYiis, —dona. F. Bt-ed>w, J. Darling, J. J. Duucan, II. Fuller, J. Martin, J. L Stirling, J. Warren, and IS. War.i (teller). NOES, 14—sir K. T. Smitb. Hons. H- Adams, A. B. Addixon, J. G. Bice, D. M. Charleston. R. s. Guthrie, W. ttaslam, A. A. Eirkpatrick. Dr. Magarey. G. Gregor, J. V. O'Loghlin, W. A. Roliinson, W. Rmsoll, and Chief Secretary (teller). These numbers meant a majority of 6 for the Noes. As it had baen arranged that the Women's Suffrage Bill should be oonsidered at 5 o'clock there were only a few minutes available to deal with the Licensing Bill. The definition of "" bona-fide lodger"" was further wracked, and with the agreement of both parties the reference to an intending Sunday night lodger was struck out. The Hou. F. Basedow moved to reduoe the qualifying Sunday travelling distance from ten to five miles. Sir Edwin Smith was ridiculing the clause when progress had to be reported. THH NKW WOMAV VOTEB. At 5 o'uiock the Caiet Seoretary, with anproving smiles from the ladies in the Gallery, moved that the <oun^il agree with the new olause which enables women to vote by pent. Tbe Hon. E. Wjrd pressed for ""time"" before they made an il'-oonxidered leap into a bottomless pit. "" Whit for?"" asked the Hon. D. M. Charleston; "" to find whether the Conservatives or Liberals put it in ?"" Mr. Ward wanted to know how the voting went in the Assembly, but the President said the Council offi;ialIy had nothing to do with that: they had to oonsider the olause as it stood. Mr. Ward objeoted to tbe proviso, >vhich was put in to nullify the new olause. lie moved to strike out the proviso relating to the declaration whioh a woman who wishes to vote by post must make that she resides more than chtee milei from a pnlling-plaoe. The Hon. J. J. Duncan supported bim—"" I believe in giving all women che right tn vote through post,"" he affirmed; nut the Hon. ii. McGregor oaused a smile when he blandly remarked—"" You don't believe in women voting at all."" Mr. Duncan was bound to admit that Mr. McGregor u oorrect. He did not. There had been ^ j mandate from the country. Members were' Uing the eleobots. The clause would bear wi-9 ooastruceinn. What was meant by the state of a woman's health? If she had a headache or pricked her finger? The Chief Seoretary — "" That should euit you."" Mr. Dnncau—"" That shows the absurdity of patting it in."" Finally he regretsed that the Bill was so nearly pa%sing. There were functions for men and functions for women. (Loud oheers from the Labour oorner.) Women's funotion was — (Hon. W. A. flobinjon—""To work in faotories"")— to stay at home and not go to public meetings. The Hon. W. A. Robinson—"" L»y the telephone on for the women to vote."" Several members joined in a ducusfion whioh had a tendency more than once to become a secondreading debate. The Hon. G. McGregor charged opponents of tbe measure with insinoerity, but had to withdraw the abstraot noun. H» substituted inconsistent. He had no doubt of tbe gallantry of members. They would have enough thought for the ladies to mark th^ir voting papers for them. An attempt was made, after an hour and a quarter'.- talk, to apply the closure, but an even vote was taken, and the Chairman had to go with tbe ""Noes."" The Hon. J. Warren appealed to humanitarians to vote tor the amendment. It would be indelicate to ask women to make a declaration as to their state of health. Mr. Ward's amendment was negatived on the following division:— AYES, 19—Hons. >ir E. T. Smith, A. R- Addison, J. I)ar ing. J. J. Duncan. H. K. Fuller, i. Mar-in. W. Hussell, J. L. Stirling, I. Warren, and E. Ward (teller). Noes, 11—Hons. H. Adams. J. G Bice, D. M. Charleston, K. S. Guthrie, W. Haslam, A. A. Kirkp«trick, Dr. Magarev, G. McGregor, J. V. O'Loughlin, (teller) W. A. ilobinson, and Chief secretary Majority of 1 for tbe Noes. Then the Hon. K. Ward, in the interests of women, asked those who did not wish women to horde at the polling booth with the brute men to support an addendum to the clause, "" provided that separate voters shall be provided for women voters."" This was negatived, the clause agreed to, and now all that remains to enact adult suffrage is for Her Majesty's assent to be given to the Bill. HEAVY HEABTKD B'BROWING. The dtbate on tbe Ljan Bill in the Assembly on Tuesday exhibited new-born interest aud heavy hearts in borrowing. In moving the second readiug at 11.40 a.m. the Treasurer said the Government had intended that no fresh Loan Bill would be needed for three years, lithe reduction in tht> Government proposals Dad bean mucu greater thau the b2uO,OOj on tbe pastoral improvements, the Government would have been obliged to subaic auocher Loan Bill n»jct year; but an ess auy 'great undertakings were decided up>u, there would ba no necessity for another Bill even in tbe next two years. As to the provisions in tbe Bill for tbe loeue of bonds or micribed scocic, three years ago a portion of che 1SUU <toek was sold to the Saving. B-tuk with the expressed engagement that the Bank would bd permitted to cake bonds in lieu o; inscribed stock, and the principal interest would be made payable in Adelaide instead ot in Ljadon. To carry out that a<reemeut pro vision was made here. There was another alteration of the form of issue, where in clause 2 they provided for the issue of a loan for a lixed deposit of ten years, with the right ol repaying an the I'teasurer might direct after the expiry of ten years. Lf tie House coasidered a longer period was necessary the Gjvernmeat would uot b - averse to lucreasiug the trrma, But judging by events in utiier oouutrtes che ten years' limit would not prejuiice che Government getting a lair prioe tor their stock. l'hey might expect lower interest as the years passed, and with the pjssible roduotious it might be thought that per cent, would sutfiue. At a quarter t > 12 Mr. Grainger moved the adjournment of the debate, as he had not read the Bill, the printer's ink was wet. It contained a new priuuiple. The Government opposed Che adjuurnmeuc. Vtr. Graiuger being defeated by 31 to 13, iu a »plendij outburst of honest indignation remarked chat fools rushed inwaerdan^elsfetredcocread. The recent division showed the extreme necessity for the entire reform of Parliament. Not five member* had read the Bill. Though taxpa) ers were distressed, here was a proposal to borrow a million of mouey, aud members were not allowed time to even read the Bill. Mr. Hombarg—Bill couid have been brought down mouths ago. Mr. Graiuger—Certainly. On the i£6timaces members with a retail miud would spend hours on a forage allowance. V""et the expenditure of a million was rushed through with indecent and expensive haste. No wouder che outside publio sneered at Parliament. The couduot of the Ministry justified the Council iu rejecting the BilL He explained the differeuiM between bonds and stooks, and said the Treasurer was not game enougn to move the Coa-oiidated Stocks Bill. The Treasurer—I would have been too glad if you had not wasted time. Mr. Graiuger veheuiently repudiated tbe suggestion, and blamed the MiuUtry and Hiuisterialists for blocking buiiness. Thei«su9of bonds sprung upon them in VCr. HilWa speeoii was unsound and obsolete, and inoonvenient to deal with. The Treasurer — The Savings Bank want bonis simply beoause it saves expense. Mr. Grainger maintained that the four previous loans floated at a discount were illegal. Interest should be paid quarterly. Clavue 2 provided that the stock snould be redeemable at par in all or by instalments at the option of the Treasurer after %ix mouths' notice. Bvery financial authority would lau^a at the idea. How would he miuage it. Toe Treasurer I will tell you in Committee. Mr. Grainger ridiculed drawing by lot for varying stock. They could do it with bonds beoause they 3oald heel mark them. If they had a surplus and the bonds were cheap it would be a good thing to buy them back. The Treasurer What, tralfie in our stock ? Mr. Grainger Yes. The English Government did it. The Treasurer—No. Mr. Grainger—The Commissioners of Public Debt did. When we bad thoie Commissioners they oould do it. Ha argued for interminable stook. Consolidation at 3 per cent, would save South Australia £50.00 J or £60,000 a year. At the time we consolidated our stock we oould raise the money in the colony. What did the Labour members think of no publio works polioy for three years? Clause 3 giving che form of the bonds was evidently obsolete. Referring to clause 6 he observed chat verv little oritioism was given otfioers who derived their salaries from loan. Clause 8 was meant to deal with the arrangement with theSivings Bank, but it ought not to be carried in this way. People in England would not understand it, as there was no reference to the Bank. He had no faith iu sinking funds. There was no investment whilst the sinking fuud gas aooruing. It would be preferable to borrow cheap and pay off the dear money, but the i8*u>) of annuities was even more preferable. The sitting was suspended from I to 2 p.m. Upon resuming Mr. Grainger advised the Government to ftart Post-Office Savings Binks. Amidst oheers he oensured those who having purposes to serve tried to oause a run upon the Savings Bank. Olause 8 should be excised and a short Bill passed giving stockholders option to convert stookB into bonds or vice verta. The colony wants a Cassandra, and has tbe oharaoter in Mr. Giles who repeated his dolorous warnings against the policy of finanoial drift. Optimistic Mr. Butler followed, though he demurred to tbe costliness of the Beetaloo and other works. Ponderous Mr. Horn burg, like other lawyers in th« Honse, has a weakness for finances, and ,ay some day but"" forth into a Treasurer. 'The unraised balances should b6 issued in interminable Btock. In the absence of the members for Gladstone and Wal- laroo, Mr. Horn burg noted that those districts invariably profited by Loan Acts. Enough bad been spent in digging up that mudhole Port Pirie. (Laughter.) Let it silt up and give Pore Gerinein a tramway. There would be enough water in the Port Pirie oreek for barges if they wanted water traffic. (Laughter.) Port Augusta was a grand Government natural port with splendid wharfs. Mr. Foster smiled approvingly. The Commissioner of Crown Lands (confidently)—But have you seen Port Broughton? (Laughter.) Mr. Homburg—Port Broughton will ba wiped off the map soon. (Oh.) Ouly £20!> out of the £3,0u0 asked for was wauted for deepening ou&porcs. There was £t>,000 in hand for deepening Port Adelaide, from which temporary transfers oould be made for contingencies. The Port members looked glum, it-id the Treasurer with pious horror in his tones interacted—Do notcanotion that surt of thing ! With pity, Mr. Homburg, looking over his glasses—Now, what's the use of the Treasurer talking like chat. He has doneitsooften before that his protest does not beoouie him. Later on in the afternoon the member for Gladstone patriotically defended Port Pine. Mr. Homburg noted that £3,000 more than was required was asked for the South-Kastern drainage works. Mr. Hague oonsidered the ten-years redemption too brief, and doubted the expediency of oompleting the Bsetalo' works. Mr. Caldwell, who was prevented earlier in the day from making a general accack on "" Hansard,"" repeated hisooooplaint, and expressed the hope that Mr. Grainger's financial speeoh to-day would be fully reported. He regretted that "" Hansard"" reporting reoently had been so unsatisfaotoiy in the sense that members' speeches were so muoh curtailed. Probably the contract had been taken too low, and a saving was sought to be effected by oondensing tbe reports. Injustice to members was possible where the remarks of members were ehorcened in this way. He regrected chat nothing bad been done for che unemployed. He knew one gentleman willing to take a quarter of a million of the loan. Mr. Mouleat4.19 complained that the Treasurer bad not puc the position of the Loau Fund properly before i he House. ""In regard to"" Mr, Gilbert—Mr. Gilbert uses that phrase about a t>oore of times a uiinute—he wanted more information, and like Oliver Twist's caterer, she Trea-urer looked aghast. Mr. Grainger backed up the demand, and the Treasurer retired from the oontest with good intentions—he would meet requirements in Committee. Mr. Gilbert enumerated national mistakes to justify pinching the Trea-urer. At 5 o'clock Mr. Ash protested pgamsi works he ng put in the schedule which should not be paid forouc of loan. If items such as loans to blockers were put in the sohedule he did not think the Kngiieh people would lend the money. Mr. Ltudseer, in his philosophic pe4simism and Piokwic-kian grandiloquence, travelled outside the Bill. Mr. K<ddouh advised the uie of the brike to che liuanoial coach. The Hippy Valley Waterworks might be reduoed by £50,000 or £6U,0U0. At present it was unnecessary to borrow any further money for pastoral improvements, as the Government had £253,000 available. The Hon. A. Cact ouoluded some time ago that the small community of South Australia had borrowed sufficient. Certainly money should be obtained oheaper. Considering the Beetaloo scheme was only about two-thirds completed it would be most uuwise to discontinue the reticulation. The ten y*-ar redemption stook was unwise. Silent Vtr. Kiily oroicx another long miell oi peace by aivo2atiug a reduction in nearly all the item*. He fauoied toll-gates aud wh^el taxes would be a good thing. Mr. Brooker praised Kilkenny steel pipes. Keterriug to the steel-pipe fid Mr. Howe deeoribed the overworked Engineer-in-Chief as a "" Booh Pah."" The mental transposition indicated that the long«it^ings wereovertaxing Mr. Howe's brain. Shortly after the tea hour arrived as an oasis in the Sahara of debate. On the House resuming the majority of members were either in the lobbies or on the marble steps enjoying the evening air, and disinclined to rpeak to a thin House. Major Castice called attention to the few members present, and a quorum bad to be made up. After ten miuutes' further contribution to "" Hansard"" oy the member for Wooroora, the Treasurer ro e to reply. He agieed with much Mr. Grainger had i>aid, particularly with his conclusions. Having read a lot upon the subject, and formed suggestions based on tbe experience of the other colonies and other parts of the world, be very much tegretted having to lay the Consolidation Bill aside. firm oonvtocion was chat no large saving was «o be realized by entering into any large scheme of loan conversion, oecause the stockholders had a right to payment of inter«ac at the covenanted rates until the t6rms expired. In no further loans should the Government bind themselves for any long period. Supposing they issued 3 per cent, stock at £92 or £i)3, would not the fact of the possibility- within ten years of the loan being paid off at par induce t-nderers' to tender at a higher rate than if they chougot redemption was further distant? It was quite possible to apply the principle of redemption to inscribed or registered stock as well as to bonds Supposing the Treasurer found himself with £250,000 in hand, he could notify the holders of the stock Or bonds that 25 per cent, of the loan would be repaid. VIr. Grainger had said this was not practicable. He held that it was. They ought to issue stock in going to London, but it was better to deal in bouds locally. Iu evrry case they should do what would best suit their customers. Replying to remarks that the Government weie piling up the burden of taxation, he pointed out that in 1891 £2 12s. fid. represented the taxation per head of the papulation, and year by year the total per head had been reduced until last year it stood at £2 4s. 10d. per he«i. The Government pledged themselves not to raise any of the money before it was wanted. At quarter-past 8 the second reading was oarried. Iu Committee, Mr. Moule in the chair, Mr. Grainger on olause 2, for reasons previously stated, moved to excise ""binds or."" Negatived by 28 to 6. Mr. Grainger, having called attention to the obscurity of the olause, the Treasurer introduced verbal alterations. . As a compromise between Mr. Grainger and Mr. Holder "" twenty "" years for redemption was suoetituted for ""leu."" An amendment determined chat the option as co payment of principal and interest in London or Adelaide was to be fixed at the time of sale. Krom olause 3 the Treasurer struck out ""£3 10s."" in the 12th line and ""paid on"" in the 15th and 16th lin~s. Consequent amendments were made in olause 4 dealing with application of moneys. In olause 8 the Treasurer inserted after ""proper"" in line 3 ""and as he may have agreed to tell to the Savings Bank of South Australia."" Clause 9 passed. On the consideration of the schedule Mr. Aeh moved to include tbe schedule in the Parliamentary Paper. The Treasurer said it was unnecessary to give a lot ot detailed infoimation to the bondholders. Amendment negatived by 28 to 8. On the motion of the Treasurer the words ""and equipment"" were inserted after ""raiways."" Mr. Hague moved to reduce the railway accommodation aooount by £100,000 with the view of using the un-xprnded balances subject to a Loan Transfer Bill next year. The Treasurer said if all the loan balances were mopped up this year as the hon. member suggested and any reduction were made a loan for the South-Eastern drainage would be necessary next year. Mr. Giles predioted that the South-Eastern people would never agree to the bet:er""ion principle. Sir John Downer contended thfat it wvs a downright hnd principle r ir P riiam«nt to authorize a loan and allow tbe Government to borrow when it united tbem. At 9.50 p.m. Mr. Hague's proposition wa« oarried by tbe acting Chairman's casting-vote, the voting being 17 on eaoh side. To stop the further reticulation in the Beetaloo water district Mr. Giles moved to reduoe waterworks—£379,000— by £120,000. The Hon. J. H. Howe and Mr. Grainger protested against the amendment, which tbe Treasurer also opposed. Mr. Ash, Mr. Burgoyoe, and Mr. Foster entered a protest against the protective duty on pipes. Mr. Brooker again championed the local manufacturers. Mr. Archibald remarked that while the pipe industry bad found employment for people it had given a fortune to the manufacturers. Mr. Riddoch oould see no adequate return from the Beetaloo works. He would like to see small reservoirs extending over a large area of oountry. Mr. Giles's amendment was negatived by 20 to 11. On tbe item, £50,000 construction of roads, Sir John Downer thought it was time ehey stopped this expenditure from loam. The Treasurer explained that he had been flooded with applications, and the money would be spent as good claims oame in. It was only fair that distriots without railways should have oon- • ideration. Mr. Brooker wanted the expenditure spread over five years. Tbe Treasurer replied that that oould be provided for upon the Loan Eit^uutm. Sir John Downer and Mr. Ash protested against the iteai. Mr. Poynton reminded the Cnight about bis address, which blamed the Labour patty for starving the roads. Sir John retorted that his views as to expenditure out of revenue were different to that out of loan. A little by-play followed between the Knight and the Labour party about their antagonisms. The item was passed. Mr. MoPberson proposed to reduce improvements on pastoral leases, £200,000, by one half. Major Castine went one better by moving to strike off £150,000. Roth amendments were negatived, and the item was passed. Mr. Ash moved to rednne ""other loan works £87,800* to £20,000. He gave his reasons previously. The amendment was negatived by 24 to 6, and the item was passed. The Bill at amended was taken through its remaining stages and passed."

Ein wohlgelockerter Boden saugt den Regen in viel größerer Menge auf, als j ein solcher von dichter, festgelagerter Beschaffenheit, bei welchem ein großer Teil, ohne in den Boden zu dringen, auf der Oberfläche abfließt. Das Behacken befähigt dem- nach den Boden, die Niederschläge in viel größerem Maße den Lieferen Bodenschichten und demnach den Pflanzen- wurzeln zuzuführen, als dies bei fester nicht durch Be- hacken gelockerter Bodenfläche der Fall ist. Andererseits wirkt auch das Behacken der Verdunstung des Wassers aus dem Boden entgegen. Der feste Boden leitet das Wasser schneller aus der Tiefe in die oberen Schichten; es wird daher bei trockener Luft aus dem festen Boden mehr Waffer an die Lust abgegeben, als aus lockerem. Lockert man daher die Oberfläche des Bodens nicht durch Behacken, so ist eine stärkere und natürlich unerwünschte Austrocknung der die Pflanzenwurzeln umgebenden Schichten die Folge. Man erreicht daher durch das Behacken in Beziehung auf die Feuchtigkeit den doppelten Vorteil: der Regen wird vollkommen ausgenützt und das einmal im Boden vorhandene Wasser besser erhalten. Daß dieser Einfluß des Behackens oder allgemeiner gesagt, die Lockerung der Bodenoberfläche in den verschiedenen Bodenarten in ungleichem Maße zur Geltung kommt, liegt auf der Hand. Ein Thonboden, welcher sich bekanntlich sehr leicht verschließt, wird sich gegen das Behacken dankbarer erweisen, als ein Sandboden, oder ein solcher von leichter Beschaffenheit überhaupt, weil letzterer an sich schon den durch das Behacken hervorgerufenen Zustand in mehr oder weniger hohem Grade besitzt. Wie oft behackt werden soll, hängt selbstverständlich von den Witterungs- und Bodenverhältnissen ab. De schlimm? en Blutttanlheiten werden durch Ayr's SärsäpärÄa «Spirt. itnh in ?imer Zeit. Der Zoologische Garten hat wieder einen Zu- wachs bekommen. Aus London erhielten wir im Austausch einige prächtige Gazellen und außerdem haben in vergangener Woche beide Büffelkühe im Garten gekalbt. Eines der nied- lichen Tiere ist schneeweiß, das andere dunkelbraun. Der am letzten Mittwoch abgegangene Dampfer „Orizaba"" nahm hier unter anderem ein nach London bestimmtes Consignment von 826 Kisten Butter im Gewicht von 21 Tonnen an Bord. Die Sendung fiel Verhältnis- mäßig klein aus, da es an Raum mangelte. Einer neu- lichen Mitteilung M. B. Doungs zufolge, haben hervor- ragende Sachverständige nach sorgfältiger Untersuchung der hier fabrizierten Butter erklärt, unser Produkt lasse, was Geschmack, Farbe, Packung ?c. anbelange, nicht das Ge ringste zu wünschen übrig. Daß nicht nur wir von kommerziellen und finanziellen Sorgen aller Art bedrängt werden, ja, daß eS vielmehr in andern Ländern vielleicht noch schlimmer steht, läßt sich (so schreibt ein Adelaide? Blatt) deutlich genug aus den neuesten Kabelnachrichten über die Lage der Dinge in Neu- fundland ersehen. Dort hat nämlich die Commercial Bank, die Union Bank und sogar die Regierungs-Sparbank ihre Zah- lungen eingestellt. Die Folge davon ist natürlich, daß viele große Firmen ebenfalls zusammengebrochen und Hunderte brotlos geworden sind. — Da steht man, wie wenig selbst eine staatliche Kontrolle über die Sparbanken wert ist. Die Estimate« für das Nordterritorium sind in verflossener Woche dem Parlament zur Kenntnis gebracht worden. Abgesehen von dem Defizit und den Bond- Interessen werden die Einnahmen auf £65,692, die Aus gaben auf £69,285 veranschlagt. Ende dieses Finanzjahrs rechnet man, daß das Defizit auf £354,536 angeschwollen sein wird. Herr C.L. Meyer in Adelaide ist per Kabel ve- nachrichtigt worden, daß . er bis auf weiteres mit der Füh- rung der Geschäfte des österreichisch-ungarischen Konsulats betraut worden ist. Ueber die Bark „F o r m o s a"", die am 4. August von London nach Port Adelaide abging, fehlt seit über 140 Ta- gen jede Nachricht. Dem Schiff scheint demnach etwas zu- gestoßen zu sein. Letzten Nachrichten zufolge ist Mr. Burney Boung jetzt mit der neuen Einrichtung des südaustralifchen Pro- dukten-Depöts so ziemlich fertig. Es waren darin ansang November bereits zwischen 300 und- 400 Oxhoft Wein ge- lagert. Mr. Young unterläßt auch nichts, um unser Pro- dukt in wirksamer Weise zu annoncieren und sehr häufig stellen sich Kenner zum Probieren ein. Selten, daß das Urteil für uns ein ungünstiges gewesen wäre. Lord Ripon, der britische Kolonialse- k r e t ä r, hat unserem Generalagenten in London, dem Ehrenw. Thos. Playsord, neulich erklärt, er könne ihm noch nicht die leiseste Andeutung geben, wer zum Nachfolger Lord KintoreS ausersehen sei. Vielfach ist man bekanntlich über- zeugt, daß unser Cheftichter Way demnächst im Government House einziehen werde. In einem neulichen Briefe des Londoner „Register""-Korrespondenten heißt es, Mr. Play- ford habe sich entschieden gegen die Erhebung Mr. Way's in den erblichen Adelstand (Baronetcy) ausgesprochen, da das Prinzip, in der Kolonie solche Klassenunterschiede zu schaffen, in jeder Hinsicht zu verdammen sei. Ein geschätzter Abonnement, E. N. L. in Wallaroo sendet unS folgende selbsterlebte Episode aus! ^dem deutschen Militärleben: In „Bunte Bilder"" Ihres jüngsten Blattes, bringen Sie aus dem Leben des Grasen Häseler einen kleinen Militärschwank. Erinnerungen aus dem Soldatenleben klingen immer wohl- thuend für das Ohr alter Soldaten, und sind auch mehr oder weniger interessant und belehrend für die Jugend. Hier etwas Selbsterlebtes: „Es war im Jahre 1847. Die 7. Artillerie^Brigade hielt ihre jährlichen Schießübungen, verbunden mit Festungsmanöver auf der Weseler Haide. Die erste Hälfte der Manöverzeit war der uninteressante ! Kommisdienst, wie Batteriebau und sonstige Vorbereitungen zu größeren Ereignissen, die da kommen sollten. Endlich traf die Nachricht von der Ankunft des Prinzen von Preußen, des späteren Kaisers Wilhelm I., ein. Diese Mitteilung j brachte mehr Regung und Leben in die Reihen der Soldaten, - denn die Anwesenheit des Prinzen — schon damals bekannt j als Streng und Recht — hat bei einer gut geschulten ; Truppe, nicht wie man gewöhnlich annimmt, ein beklem- mendes, sondern stets ein beruhigendes Selbstgefühl, aufge- baut durch gute und ehrenhafte Offiziere, die ihren Stolz in der Tüchtigkeit ihrer Soldaten suchen, und nichts mit ! dem SchindereiSystem zu thun haben. Der erste Befehl für den kommenden Tag war „Gefechtsübung"". Das ! Wetter war drohend und schon gegen Abend stieg Vater ! Pluvius von seinen Höhen und goß fein überflüssiges Naß auf die geduldige Erde nieder. Es regnete die ganze Nacht fast ununterbrochen und selbst noch am nächsten Morgen, > als unsere Batterien sich dem Manöverplatze näherten. I Die Schwierigkeiten, womit wir zu kämpfen hatten, waren nicht geringe, denn der Boden war so sehr eingeweicht, daß die Räder der Geschütze oft knietief einsanken. Der Prinz mit seinem Generalstabe war nicht sehr weit von unserer Batterie entfernt. Die erste und dritte Brigade-Abteilung I gab ihr erstes Feuer und nach der dritten Salve kam der Befehl, „zum Gefecht aussitzen"". Alles in Ordnung. Wir trabten lustig durch Regen und Schmutz, bis, o weh! beide Räder der Lafette meines Geschützes sich derart in den ein- > geweichten Boden eingruben, daß die Zugpferde nicht an- ziehen wollten oder konnten. Unser Batteriechef, Haupt- mann Vogel von Falkenste'm, später 1870171 kommandieren- der General, welcher sich stets durch Ruhe und Scharfblick schon damals auszeichnete, kam näher, besichtigte unsere Situation und erteilte einige Befehle. Inzwischen kam der Prinz mit feinem Stabe und hielt, kaum hundert Schritt von unserem Standpunkt entfernt. Wir versuchten mit Schaufel und Hacke die Rade* bloßzulegen, und anders Arten von Kraft-Manövern wurden in Anwendung gebracht. Aber vergebens, das Geschütz wollte nicht weichen. Der Prinz saß fast unbeweglich im Sattel; fem scharfes Auge war auf unsere Arbeit gerichtet und dieser ruhige Blick wirkte fast bedrückend auf die Mannschaft. t Da näherte sich wir ein Kanonier (sein Name, wenn mein Gedächtnis treu, war August Herzog), ein Westphale von herkulischem Bau und Stärke, dessen Kraft oft genug in Spiel und Turnen erprobt war: „Herr Unteroffizier,"" sagte er, „soll ik it rut Halen?"" Im ersten Augenblick verstand ich die Bedeutung dieser Worte nicht, und in meinem Stillschwei- gen deutete er meine Bejahung. Schnell war ein Hebe- bäum quer hinter das Geschütz als Stützpunkt in eine Ver- tiefung gelegt und ein anderer Hebebaum in die Geschütz- mündung gebracht. Unser Herkules stellte sich dann fest aus den Stützpunkt hinter dem Geschütz, setzte seine Schulter unter den Hebel in der Mündung und winkte mir zu: „Seggen Se den Fahrern, dat sie stk fertig malen."" Kaum war das Wort heraus, so hob der Mann die ganze Lafette mit Geschütz aus dem triefenden und schmutzigen Boden, Ms ut fptttpr ptrtMtptt in die .Rübe, rief: ..Na man tau Jungens"" und fort ging das befreite Geschütz. Wir konnten dann auch wieder Teil am Schießen nehmen. Am nächsten Tage zum Appell erschien der Adjutant des Prinzen. Er ließ unfern Herzog vortreten und versicherte, daß der Prinz mit voller Zufriedenheit den Ausgang des gestrigen Vorfalls beobachtet habe; er hob auch besonders hervor, daß im Falle eines Krieges durch solch unvorhergesehene Er- eignisse ein Geschütz leicht in die Hände des Feindes fallen könne, wenn es nicht durch die zeitige Krastanwendung eines solchen Mannes gerettet werde. Im Namen des Prinzen überreichte er unserem Kanonier zwei doppelte Friedrichsd'or als Anerkennung für seine That. Wie man sich denken kann, lief dies Ereignis wie ein Lausfeuer durch das ganze Regiment. Am nächsten Tage war Festungsmanöver. Fast alle Bastionen waren in voller Bereitschaft, die Mannschaft schössen und warfen aus ihren Geschützen und Mörsern mit stoischer Ruhe, obgleich weder Franzosen noch Russen im Gesichtskreis erschienen. Der Prinz war bereits auf der Bastion und beobachtete scharf Alles, was die Bewegungen nnd Manipulationen der Mannschaft betraf. Da kam der Befehl, daß drei Mörser von ziemlich schwerem Kaliber, von einer Batterie zu einer andern gebracht werden sollten. „Ein Mörser ruht auf einer schweren hölzernen Unterlage, „woran 4 Ringe befestigt sind, durch diese Ringe kommen „zwei lange Tragbäume (Hebe!) und das Ganze wird von „2—4 Mann, je nach der Schwere des Geschützes, befördert."" Ein kräftiger junger Mann, dem wohl die zwei Doppel- Friedrichsd'or von gestern im Sinne lagen, erfaßte eigen- händig einen Mörser mit Unterlage, hob ihn hoch genug empor und trug das sehr schwere Objekt ungefähr 150 Schritt weit, vor fich hin. Auch dieses Kraftstück blieb von vem Blicke des Prinzen nicht unbemerkt. Er erkundigte fich nach der Kopfstärke der Mannschaften der Batterie und erklärte, daß im Falle eines Krieges, wenn die Bedienungsmann schaft durch feindliche Kugeln erheblich dezimiert wären, die Anwendung solcher Stärke zwar wohl Anerkennung verdiene, wenn jedoch Mannschaften hinreichend wie jetzt vorhanden wären, könnte die Anwendung solcher Kraftproben nur als extravagant bezeichnet werde». Er diktierte hieraus dem Mann 24 Stunden Mittelarrest zu, wegen „unnützer Ver- schwendung feiner Kräfte."" - , Ayer'S Sarfopanlla wirkt gründlich auf das Blut ein, uud ist ein sicheres, zuverlässiges Mittel gegen H: verschiedenen Krankheiten, die aus Schwäche oder aus einer in der Konstitution liegenden Verderbnis der Säfte hervorgehen. ' Tommy Walker hat mal wieder Unheil angerichtet. Am Sonnabend Abend suchte er, wahrscheinlich angetrunken, einige in Gouger-Street spielende Kinder zu erschrecken. Die Kleinen stoben auseinander und einer von ihnen geriet da- bei unter die Räder einer passierenden Droschke. Der Arzt konstatierte Ouetschung der Leber und Nieren, und der Zu- stand des Kindes ist sehr bedenklich. Am i. Dez. hatten sich eine Anzahl junger Leute im East Adelaide Hotel mit Bagatelle-Spiel un- terhalten und dabei so kräftig gekneipt, daß sie sämtlich mehr oder weniger angetrunken waren. In der Gesell schaft befand sich auch ein gewisser Joseph Matthews; die- ser soll aus der Straße Krakehl angefangen haben mit dem Resultat, daß einer von ihnen, George Gregory mit Na- men, ihn heftig zu Boden warf. Matthews scheint dabei I schwer am Kopfe verletzt worden zu sein und an den Fol- gen eines Schädelbruchs starb er. Nach längerer Unter- suchung wies der Coroner am Montag den Gregory wegen Totschlags vor die Geschwornen. (Eingesandt). Bethel, 12. Dez. 1894. In Nr. 49 j der „Australischen Zeitung"" findet sich ein Absatz über die Brüdergemeine Christiansfeld, mit einer sich daran schließen- den statistischen Angabe über unsre Mission und endlich eine ganz eigenartige Darlegung des Vorgangs bei der Ver- heiratung unsrer Misstonare. Schon einige Male fanden sich in der „Australischen Zeitung"" Notizen über die Brü- dergemeine, zumal zur Zeit der jüngst tagenden Synode, welche den mit den Verhältnissen bekannten Leuten nicht ganz richtig ° erscheinen mußten, und bei den mit den Ver- Hältnissen unbekannten Leuten falsche Vorstellungen erwecken mußten. So verhält es sich auch dieses Mal. Ob Ihr Gewährsmann die „Fl. Nachr."" für das Ganze verantwort- lich ist, weiß ich nicht, das erste über Christiansfeld Gesagte ist richtig. Die Statistik über die Mission stellt sich nach t dem „Jahresbericht über das Missionswerk der Brüderge- meine vom Juli 1893 bis Juli 1894"" etwas anders dar, als in der „Austr. Ztg."" Aber der Schluß kann heutzu- j tage nicht mehr anerkannt werden. Eine ausführliche ge- schichtliche Darlegung der Lossrage würde mich hier zu weit führen, nur soviel: Nach den Beratungen der Synode von 1818 gab im Jahr 1819 die Behörde der evangelischen Brüdergemeine den Gebrauch des Heiratsloses für die deutsche Provinz frei, nachdem es in der englischen und ! amerikanischen schon gefallen war. Die Synode von 1825 entband auch die „D i e n e r der Gemein e"", d. i. P r e- dig er :c., von demselben und einige Jahre später fiel der Gebrauch desselben auch bei den Missionaren. Eine eigene Wahl der Lebensgefährtin ist nie ausgeschlossen gewesen, nur mußte die Bestätigung derselben durch das Los geschehen. Um dieser ganzen Frage Verständnis entgegen zu bringen gehört eine Würdigung der kind- lichen, glaubensstarken Einfalt eines Kindes Gottes dazu, welches sein Leben unbedingt in die Führung Gottes legt. Von einem Zusammenbringen von Mädchen, deren Schaar nun das Los blindlings eine herausgreift, ist nie die Rede gewesen, muhamedamscher Fatalismus ist uns fremd. § 204 der Kirchenordnung von 1894 der cvang. Brüder- Ünität giebt das Genaueste an. Das Kinderfest wird all- jährlich in allen Gemeinen am 17. August gefeiert und ebenso das Brüdersest, dasselbe aber am 29. nicht am 19. August ; wenn nicht örtliche Verhältnisse eine Aenderung oder Verschiebung des Termins in einem oder anderen Falle wünschenswert machen. Die geschichtlichen Daten sind der 17. und 29. August. Hochachtungsvoll zeichnet Paul Buck, Prediger der Brüdergemeine Bethel. (Wir ge- ben dieser Berichtigung gern Raum. ^ D. R.) In der Anstalt für Blinde und Taub- stumme in North Adelaide befinden sich gegenwärtig 53 Insassen. Ihre Zahl hat sich im letzten Jahre um sieben vermehrt. Seit seiner Einrichtung haben in dem Asyl 139 Personen Ausnahme gefunden und von diesen sind jetzt 86 nach dem in der Anstalt empfangenen Unterricht zu nütz- lichen Mitgliedern der Gesellschaft ausgebildet und in der Lage, sich selbst den Lebensunterhalt zu erwerben. Im verflossenen Jahre gingen der Anstalt £1006 in Gestalt von freiwilligen Beitragen zu ; der Regierungszuschuß beträgt £800 pro Jahr. Der Bohrapparat, der vor einiger Zeit Ood- nadatta so reichliches artesisches Wasser verschaffte, ist jetzt abgebrochen und nach dem etwa 70 Meilen weiter nördlich belegenen Hamilton gebracht worden. Es ist eine wahre Augenweide, dem aus dem Erdreich emporsprudelnden Wasser, das sich schon ein meilenlanges, grünberändertes Bett ge- schaffen hat, Zuzuschauen. In Crystal Brook siel am 13. d. M. eine Mrs. Carter beim Wasserschöpfen in einen Tank und ertrank. Die Frau halte sich den ganzen Tag hindurch krank gefühlt und wird in einem Schwindelanfall hinabgestürzt sein. An Beweisen praktischer Sympathie fehlt es den in den verschiedenen Gegenden der Kolonie angesiedelten Dörflern fürwahr nicht. So hatten sich am letzten Sonn- abend während der Stunden von 12 Mittags bis 6 Uhr Abends und später an den Hauptverkehrspunkten der Stadt eine Anzahl angesehener Damen ausgestellt, welche von den Passanten Geld für diese Kolonisten sammelten. Die An- regung dazu war von Lady Colton ausgegangen, die auch selbst fix mitsammelte. Es wurden während des Nachmittags ca. £60 kollektiert. Ein in der Gegen d von Peters bürg hoch- angesehener Farmer, James Thyer, wurde am vergangenen Freitag dem Ortsmagistratsgericht unter der Klage, sich durch Erhängen umzubringen versucht zu haben, vorgeführt. Da Thyer erst vor einigen Monaten einen ähnlichen Streich begangen hatte, blieb dem Gerichte nichts anderes als die Überweisung an die Geschworenen übrig. Der zum australischen Geschwader gehörige Kreuzer „Goldfinch"" lief am letzten Freitag in Port Ade« laide ein. Schrecklich scheint der Typhus aus den Coolgardie Goldfeldern zu grassieren. Ein eben von dort nach hier zurückgekehrter Mr. T. A. Weflwood berichtet, daß während seines dortigen Aufenthaltes an einem Tage allein nicht weniger als 29 Todesfälle an Typhus zu ver- zeichnen gewesen seien. Den Nachbarkolonien wurde nur die Zahl der in den Hospitälern dem Fieber erliegenden Personen mitgeteilt. Todesfälle durch Ertrinken häufen sich von Woche zu Woche. So kam wieder am letzten Sonntag ein 11- jähriger Sohn des an Men OSmond Road wohnhasten Uhrmachers A. I. Day in dem Wasserloche eines nahen Steinbruchs ums Leben. Am Sonntag Morgen verstarb in seiner in Franklin Street belegenen Wohnung Dr. G e o r g e M a y o, ein ebenso alter wte bekannter und verdienstvoller Kolonist, :m gereisten Alter von über 87 Jahren. Der ehrwürdige GreiS war bis wenige Tage vor seinem Tode noch rüstig auf den Beinen gewesen und er entschlief ohne jeden To- deskampf. Nie in seinem langen Leben hatte Dr. Mayo gewußt was Krank sein bedeutet ; nur die Influenza hatte ihm vor etwa drei Jahren einmal ernstlich mitgespielt. In England gebürtig, kam er schon im Jahre 1337 als prak- tizierender Arzt in Australien an. Seit 1839 ist Dr. Mayo fast ununterbrochen in Südaustralien thätig gewe sen. Er hinterläßt 2 Söhne und 2 Töchter. Die Adult Suffrage (Frauen-Wahlrechts)- Bill ist gestern mit 31 gegen 14 Stimmen, also mit absoluter Majorität, vom Unterhause in dritter Lesung angenommen worden. Gegen die Vorlage stimmten die Abg. : Sir I. Downer, Gilbert, Giles, Grainger, Hague, E. W. Hawker, Homburg, Johnson, Kelly, Landseer, McDonald, Riddoch und Griffith. ^ Außer den schon erwähnten ITagen in der Weihnachts- und Neujahrswoche find auch Sonnabend 29. und Montag 31.

41,53659948,THE PASTORAL BILL AND PARA LYSED TRADE AND INDUSTRY.,Article,"South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)",19-12-1894,Article,4216,"THE PASTORAL BILL AND PARA LYSED TJ'.ADE AND INDUSTRY. 'To discuss in a friendly way, and free from party politics, the forfeiture clause in the Pastoral Bill now before Parliament.' is announced as the main object of a public meeting jailed by the Mayor of Ade' aide for to-day. The stagnation in ;rade which prevails at tbe present ;ime is undoubtedly greatly aggravated by the paralysis in the woolgrowing in lustry, illustrated by the indisposition to ake up new counbry or to spend money n developing territory at present occu )ied. Is is being brought home to every :lass of the community that this ia a natter which directly and intimately joncems it. It is therefore not surpris ng that merchants, manufacturers of aachinery mechanical appliances boots ind clo hing, fruitgrowers, grocers, oachbuilders, saddlers, and members of nany other trades are represented in he list of signatories to the requisition iresented to the Mayor a few days ago a Parliament men of such opposite ?iews as the Hons. F. Basedow, J. J )uncan, D. M. Charleston, W. Russell' ,nd H. Adams have given it as their [^liberate opinion, after careful enquiry, hat the tirst cure for the unemployed liiliculty is to be found in the adoption -f such liberal pastoral legislation as may cad to the immediate prosecution of ragepaying work on large areas of now leserted land. The forfeiture clause, ithough not the only example of illi -er&l and dog-in-the-manger legislation ucludcd ia the Bill now before the Council, may yet ba taken as a fair anrnle of the spirit in which the whole if the measure as now amended is con nived. What sane Bank Manager or )irector would agree to lend money for he carrying out of improvements on a ease which might at any time ba ancolled by a stroke of the ten, more particularly after the xperience which bas already been ained of the arbitrary manner in which uch forfeitures may be decided upou? low can it be expected that those who lave a lit*le money, and who are disposed orisk it notwithstanding the fearfully qw price of wool, will face the additional angers incidental to becoming tenants t will, subject to the caprice of a Cam aisBioner prejudiced against pastoralista, ven though he may have as an advisory tody a Board which is practically under i is control? Of course this is the light tn which the rholo matter naturally presents itself to hie woolgrower. But, so far as to !ay's meeting is concerned, that much* bused individual is \n outsider. Commercial men in the city are feeling how it affects trade to have vast areas of land either lying idle or but partially utilized which might be producing wool for export, thus leading to the circula tion of ready cash in the colony. In exactly tbe same way members eucIi as Messrs. Charleston, Adams, and Russell* who profess in a special degree to repre sent labour, see quite clearly, as coon as they come to make enquiries, that nothing is likely to give a greater stimulus to general industry and com merce than the adoption of a policy which will create a demand for the ser vices of hundreds of men in wellsinking, dam making, and the manufacture of troughs and windmills and all sorts of station requisites. The objec tors to a vigorous policy are of two classes, the first comprising those who have a traditional and inveterate preju dice against the squatter, or who are afraid that the State may make a bad bargain aa wool may speedily rise in price. The practical woolgrower sees no prospect of any such luck. If similar counsels had prevailed when tbe great drop in copper took place the Peninsula mines would have been closed for many a year. Then there are the drcaruera vrho wish to socialize the sheep stations in Australia With wool at od. to 5d. per lb. no Government could hope to make a profit out oi the land which is now in question. The advocates of such impracticable theories have no locus dandi whatever. The immediate desideratum is that, whatever securities the State may exact for the future occupation of the land and the payment of a fair rent, the men who are to render these tracts onco more reproductive should be encouraged to at once get to work. The motto of every true commercial and industrial leader is to 'act in tbe living present,1' and in the eyes of sensible men no amount of sophistical talk will shield members of Parliament from the odium which will attach to them it they short sightedly hamper an important producing interest at the very time when every avenue should be opened up for those who are able and willing to work. The Christmas ' Obseeveu.'— The Christ mas edition of Che Adelaide Observer is one o tbe features of the principal holiday season in Adelaide, and the issue this year is one that will afford speoial pleasure to its readers among old and young throughout Australia. The feature which has distinguished the Christ mas number for several years past baB been replaced by a still more interesting one. In placs of tha familiar coloured picture issued as a special supplement there ara a soore or two of illustrations printed with the letterpress, thus giving a more sustained interest to the issue. The purely Christmas matter it contained in a supplement of twenty four pages. This opens with a very well written article entitled 'Everybody's Christ mas,' written and illustrated by a talented yoang South Australian lady ; and it is hoped sincerely that, while everybody in the natural order of things has a Christ mas, that festive season will be spent in the midst of pleasure and creature comforts. As tire fair authoress puts it, ' Dear old Fathar Christmas haa a wondrous faculty for making himself at home in the most unlikely sur roundings ;' and we trust that such will be the case in those far-away districts where the Obisrvcr is so welcome, and the thoughts of home and friends so tenderly fostered, because ' absence m*ke» the heart grow fonder.' The whole number of this week's Obiervcr ii redolent of the joyous peason, for tho very reports of daily events allude to it in some fashion. A story with the ourious coupling 'Bush and Benob/'by O. Crow, is a pleasingly tugged sort of etory, highly flavoured with good honest Scotch, which will fall familiarly from the lips of some old grandaire aB he aits in the shade reading the ' owre true tale1' to his family or his cronies. Boys and girla are catered for in a way that delights them by a column of 'Christmas trioks and enter tainment,' in which perforated coins, questions and answers, and the vanishing penny—the penny invariably does vanish when a boy gets hold of it— are made to furnish no end of amusement ; and over ths leaf is a page full of olaverly, quaintly, and humorously drawn figures, forming a pictorial tale of thrilling interest, and there is the delightful prospect of them being used for the cherished sorapbook, coloured gorgeously. So many jwople 'drop into poetry,' like Silas Wegg, at this time of tha year tbat tbe current literature generally gets the overflow, and tba Observer is no exception. There is more than one poem on Christmas, embodying prettr and suitable sentiments. Appropri ately enough for this year of mines and rumours of mines, one author (Mr. Stanley Hamilton) has developed a delightful romanoe under the title of ' The Digger's Wedding,' in whioh manly sentiment is happily mingied with local colouring ; moreover, it. is capitally illustrated. As an adtrinaeut ' Lucy Hardy' has written about the 'Fell-Thorpe Ghost,' a ghost with whom Annie Be»ant or Mrs. Mellon would be proud to make an acquaint ance. It is a rather elongated ghost, too, for it measures over five columns. Dismissing the phantom, the reader comes upon two paces of clever etchings illustrating some verses of a humorous character. 'Two Clirmmas Eves,' pen ? driven by Mr. O. J. Macrae, runs neck and neck with 'TheCattle- stealer's Daughter,' by that olever colonial novelist Mrs. J. M. Waterhouse ; and then came more pages of pictures, flanking 'The Story of a Woman's Itevensre'— no allusion to the Suffrage Bill— and a fascinating story, 'The Enchanted Pearls,' in verse, by Lindsay Dunces. There is a taking tone of the old time in 'Rouudheads and Cavaliers,' by F. Welle, and much interest in 'The Other Lodger,' by E. Lee. To complete the allurement of this fully illus trated and wonderfully ivell-worked-up com bination of uews, solace, fun, and frolio are a stirring story by T. B. RuBiell, embellished rvitb etobinpa, the current stories ; that column in which tbe youog folk do so revel, 'Uncle Harry's Letter;' and the Echoes, by Hugh Kalyptue. The number (whioh is published to-day) comes out in anew garb suitable to the season, a pale - blue rcrappsr exceedingly well printed. Truly the Christmas number of the Obzervir is a thing of beauty and a joy for ever. PAESENV.EKS BY THE AVSTBAUA.— The following passengers are booked to loave by the P. & O. R.M.S.

The Banco Court was occupied tbe whole c? Tuesday morning arguing a question whsther bear came under the Excise duty when it was brewed, but not 'fined,' 'on' the passing of the Aot and whether 'on' meant 'at.' Again it was 'beer, beer all about, and not a drop to drink. ' In this par ticular case, unlike the one last week, the beer was not tn evidence, but it was much dis cussed. The Treasurer claimed duty on a cask of beer brewed by the S.A. Brewing Company at the time the Aot was passed, and there ware some interesting differences of opinion on the construction of the words 'on and aft*r' the commencement of tha Act. However, as the case being incomplete needed amending, Cassoll'a dictionary, the Imperial dictionary, tba ojclopsdfa;, and a hoss of law books wew put away fro ten., and tbe argu ment stands over.

The chief offijer of the Warrigal ?ays thas the steamer arrived at Delagoa Bay on Octobers with a car,jo of railway material. Nothing of no:e occurred until the morning of October 14, whim at about 0.30 the Kaffirs, who muttered 3,0'JO atron?, made on attack on the town. The majority of the Kaffirs were armed with native weapons, only a few having riling. The town had . been forDified and barricaded by the Portuguese authorities, who had munntedgunBati the acreetends, and a squad of marines from a Portuguese gunboat was landed and manned the guns. The British gunboat Thrush was at Debzon Bay to protect British interests, but her services were not required, though the English residents of Lorenzo Marquez assisted in defending the town. The Kaffirs were repulsed by the Portuguese, who expanded a great amount of powder withouc doing damage, as tho natives sustained no losa of life, while on the Portu guese side only a couple of friendly natives were killed. The Kaffira retreated about) Id xnilea into the bush, but were not pursued by the Portuguese. The Warrigal left again fot Australia on October 30, and np to that time nothing more took place ; but) the Portuguese were frightened, and expected to be again attacked. About S i0 men were expected to arrive at Delagoa Bay from Portugal abou' November 9 so quell the revolt. Fife House.— Messrs.

The firm has inaugurated a new system of trading, for the entire front of the shop is turned into an open vestibule, in which goods are so temptingly displayed and shown by obliging assistants that one is irresistibly re.ninded of an Oriental bazaar. Inside the shop also the goods r.re arrnnged in such imposing piles that extension of premises must be ever in the minds of the firm, especially when tho large staff of assis tants are coping with the demands of cus tomers who crowd like beas round a hive. Murdoch & Co 's trade ia nothing but drapf rr, aud as the principal devotes hia whole time to buying special nnd job lines in the cheapest market, which are retailed on a strictly cash basin, the public is ensured every advantage.

Thb election was quiet, but consider able interest was manifested in it, the sup porters of the rival candidates showing a good dbal of energy to secure tha return of their favourite. As on a previous occasion when he sought the suffrages of the electors Mr. Buttery had tho support of the Labour party, and again he suffered defeat, the result of the poll being— Thielfall, 228; Buttery, 175; ia formal, 7.

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 18.","Detailed Lists, Results, Guides","The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889 - 1931)",19-12-1894,"Detailed Lists, Results, Guides",21983,"LOAN BILL. The TREASURER said as to the Blythand Gladstone railwav, the whole amount would be required. Generally about £100,000 was not used for Uie purpose for which •it was voted in connection with the railways. The Government proposed introducing a Loan Transfer Bill next session, and to devote this £100,000 to carry out drainage works in die south-east. There was a small amount to the credit of the Mount Gambier and Narracoorte line, and some £10,000 to that of die line to die Victorian border, which would be required to put in sidings, especially at Belair, where die popularity of the National Park would shortly no doubt necessitate increased traffic arrange mente. ■ Mr. ASH said there were amounts epent without authority, and he would like to know where they were taken from. The sum of £100,000 would not be enough to carry out the south-east drainage works, as they were csti mated to cost a quarter of a. million. j The TREASURER said the main drain from Fumer to Mount Hope was estimated to cost £57,000, and the remainder of the works which it was proposed to 'carry out could be done for the bsfcnoe. Works like the village settlements and the St. Kilda embankment iiad been paid for oat of the genera] cash balance, but diat fact did not reduce the amount to die credit of each particular work already authorised, as the Government might be called upon to refund the amount at any' time. Sir JOHN-DOWNER hoped that the com mittee would agree to the suggestion of Mr. Hague and reduoe the vote by £100,000.' The Treasurer wished to keep in reserve die £100,000 mentioned to carry out works in the Eouth-eart, which it was verj- problematical would ever be sanctioned. The Government wanted them to proceed on the new principle of borrowing first and finding out what they had borrowed it for afterwards. Th<?re was another principle which the Trep. surer had laid down, but from which he dis sented, and diat was that wherever works were authorised the Loan Bill originally should authorise the whole amount of its cost, and the Government could raise the money when diey chose. It was a very bad principle, as was proved by the fact that the Government made no effort to raise money last year. If the Treasurer's principle was right how did he justify taking that instalment on account of die south-eastern works, which they knew would cost at least 4250,000. This was not the time to Mart these new principles which would place in the hands of thu Trea surer a large sum when it was particularly de sirable diat be should not have it, set-ing that he was surrounded bv a. strung but nwdy majority. The Treasurer already liad illK),O<K> in baud, on which he supiwsvd he was losing interest, aud he hoped the amendment would be carried. Mr. FOSTER agreed that a transfer Bfll was necessary, as the oouiiuktw did not know how tile loan accounts stood.

Sir JOHN DOWNER said the tim* had arrived when votes iu that direction out of loan nionev should cease. The TREASURER said the amount stated was what the Government thought would be required for thejmrnosc. AU tht: ckuni^ fn>m dioetent parts of the colony had been bint ou to the Inspector of Main Road*, and on his re commendation some of the money would be. voted early in the new year, while the balanue would be* granted to meet any good claims diat might come in later. In some parts of the colony the people had to depend almost entirely on their roads. Mr. BROOKER wanted some guarantee as to die number of years that the vote would be epread over. Sir JOHN DOWNER said tliat the Trea surer had been flooded with applications from corporations and district councils when it was blown the money was to be voted, but it was time the corporations and district councils looked after themselves in thU respect. Mr. ASH said it was not richt to borrow money as proposed, and he would vole against the line. Mr. POYNTON said Sir John Downer should be the last man to object to the item. There was a hu^e number of people who did not participate in the benefits received from the railways, and he hoped the committee would pass the item. Sir JOHN DOWNER considered his action with record to the road vote on the Estimates had nothing to do with the question before them. Mr. BATCHELOR said the money would be spent on labor in the country equally with the money diat came out of revenue. Sir John Downer said it was the city members who wen; trying to injure the interests of the country, but that was incorrect. Mr. CALDWELL hoped if die money were borrowed it would be fairly distributed. Item passed as printed. Improvements on pastoral leases, £300,000. Mr. McPHERSON moved that a further sum of £100,000 be taken off the rate. Mr. CASTtNE moved as an amendment to reduce die item by £130,000. The TREASURER hopud after the con cession made by the Government on Friday that the committee would not agree to either amendment. The Government had to pay up to the end of the year £1^!,000, and Lad in hand £223,000. Next year there was £127,0(10 more to pay, go that members would eee that by tbe end of 1596 all the money asked for would be wanted. Tbe item passed as printed. Buildings. &e.. £3.fc00. The TREASURER, in reply to Mr. Akh, said that meant the Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery, with tlm fboii'-cases and fittings.

Mr. HOURIGAN said the BUI had been so ably discussed in all its stage* that very little was loft t? be said, but as he bad l>eeu a be liever in woman's suffrage ever since he. began to study politics, lie would not like to give a silent vote on so important and necessary a change in our constitution. This Bill has beeu supported by many hon. members on the ground that women were mentally equal to men; but he voted for it principally on the grounds ol common jttsticp. Wooieu with men were held equally res)Kinsible for the due obser vanceof thelaw. and therefore they should have an equal voice in making the laws they were called upon to obey. It had been said that if they give women a vote it would lead to no end of domestic quarrels and destroy the sanctity of the home. That was about one. of the weakest arguments that could lie used against the Bill. He would remind members of die domestic life of no less a person thau the Queen of England and her bite husband. If all they read was true of the Queen and her husband their life must have been one long ray of light full of contentment and happiness. They heard nothing uf the political duties of the Queen interfering with the sanctity of the borne, and yet she presided over the destinies of the greatest Empire the world had ever seen. Brought as she was into daily contact with statesmen, ambassadors, and representa tives from every country in the world, she nec«ssarilv devoted a dual of time with h.-r re sponsible Ministers to questions affecting the Empire. In spite of all that they were told by no li'ws an authority tluui the Queen herself that iur family life with her husband was one of bliss. Surely if a woman was* able to fulfil all Uiise duties without any friction in her domestic lift- it was not too much to say that the women of South Australia could go to the jioll oneo in three years and record their vot<-s without any disastrous eonsefjuenci'S arising in their domestic circle. Then they were told by the opponents of this measure tliat the great body of women were ignorant on political ques tions and that if tbe franchise were, extended tu them th<-y wuu!d not know how ta usv it. Tiie very same reasons were advanced acainst extending the franchise to riieu, but what liad been the result? The greatest opjwuent? of extending the franchise to men had lived to mx i=onie of these very men win i were denied a vote fleeted as memliers of Parliament. Without the slightest doubt the same thing would be experienced in the case of women. There was nothing m the argument that women had hitherto taken but little interest in politics, because he maintained that tome of the noblest and most self -sacrificing women in South Australia were leading the van for the political emancipation of their sex. If there were Borne women wiio did not trouble themselves about political questions and who did not want the vote it was no argument against those who did. The former couldcarry out their convictions by treating the whole tbiu^ with contempt and by not going to the poll. Why was it that the gre.at majority of women had not taken a greater interest in politics • It was sininly because for thousands- of years the s?x had been treated as if vromen were little better than serfs. Woman had been made to believe that her principle duty in life was to make hemelf pleasing to hrr husband, to cook his food, wash his clothes, mead his eocks, and bear him children. When one thought of tiie tn-atinent women had l?-'n subjected to in the fust it wae t-x> rc-ixiltng- for one to sp-sk about with calmness*. Thanks to the spread of education, we wen: lteginning to ivalise the fart that a woman had a |>erfect right to every lulitical privilege pussvK-M iiy man, and If went furthrr and hai<l sin- hud' one more, and that was man's jiroiection, liecause she wat physically ?""i_-?k«r. Ah .soon as wora« i were in jxsseSMun of their political rights they would awake to the consciousness o: their political duties. Women wuuld obtain political education by being allowed to exercise, what was undoubtedly their political rights. Hitherto the ruling dames had •■ndoavon'd to serve their own ends bylc«?ping women in ignorance, bv telling them tliat they jrou]d be going beyond thiir sphere if they dabbled in politics, and by affirming that they wnuid ilotruy the peace and happi n**s •>( their liunitsi. As eoon as women ob tained a vote it would b- the starting point of a number of cuuunon interests between hus band and wife which instead of being detri mental to their mutual relationship would, on the contrary, materially improve it.

AU"" that wa? Iwst in him was due to thu pure aud holy influmoa of woman, and lie. did notbelievo the suffrage would lower her in anv way. Mr. Solomou had b.r-n uuiMKteut in af« «vb trying to wreck thismaiu>ure. (Mr. Solomon—"" Hear, hear;"" and Mr. Johnaou —"" You bring us here at half-past 10 to stonewall your own 15iU.') He wan pleasocl tu ui'ius Imdin^ article i;i th« Rryitirr tliat they are still hold nifr to the views they formerly ox intxasi-d. The article uoucluded as fullovrh:— Thu wouder is that thu woman's suffrage propagauda should not U< supported here, u it is in England, by thu Conservative party. The probability is that women will prove to uu conservative in the best sense, and that 10 years honoe, if thu «>ooasion should arise, the votes giveu yesterday on the Bill will be re vursed. The immediatx effect of the paaaing of thu measure—if the law be not altered in other respects —will be to give a new advan tage to property -holders in the shape of au extended franchise for the Upper House under conditions expUinod recently by Mr. Bootiiby. Regarding the ultimate resulc there U warrant for fresh hope rather than for increased appre huusion, especially us the education of women has advanced bo remarkably. Thu present franchise is responsible for the exceedingly unsatisfactory condition of Parliament. Can a worse thinx follow from its extension?"" Un the second reading be said he beliuvudjt would tend ratlier to a Conservative than a Radical influence, and that it must materially strengthen the „ Conservative party in the Up|>cr Chamber, because the propertied classes could give their feuule relatives the necessary qualifiuitiou. lie supported the measure because it was just and right. He did not believe the Hill would injure the country districts, and «4 a producer he was not likely to support anything detrimental to the class to which he belonged. In Neiv Zealand the women in t'uti country polled as hnavily as in the towns; 85 |kt cent, of those on the rolls voted, and {H> per cent, of those qualified enrolled themselves. In the last election the dwellers in thu country in South Australia polled 4 to 5 per cent, more than those living in the towns. It did not necessarily follow that a policy which benefits: thu town will nut bene fit the country ; the fact was beginning to be recognised tluit unless the producers are prosperous there could lie uo real pros]>ericy in tiie city. He wouhi not sujjport the Ml if lie saw any chance of its injuring the producers. A very able speech had been made on the sub ject iu IHBS by an ex-member of the House, Dr. Stirling, who said :—"" Was not education the same great blessing to women as to men, and was it uot iu fact from a woman that «'e re wived our earliiiiL and U*t lesions in the foundation of our character* (Hear, hcur.) Did not war itself bring to womeu the same burdens of taxation as to men, and did it uot often bring besides the pain and anguish of a desolated home.* (Hear, hear.) And yet it was considered that the voioe of women should he unheard and have no imlui-noe in the deter mination of these momentous questions. So long as half the human race was unrepresented our boasting representative Government was a hollow mockery of an ideal which it did not even approach. Now, out of these arose two objections which had lieen urged. It was said that the influence, already wielded by women was considerable, and was as much as was good for them, lie admitted that no one who was a student of history or an observer of the ways of the world could deny that a great deal of influence was wielded by women."" He recommended the Biii to the consideration of hon. memljers. Mr. GRIFFITHS said be had always opposed the UiU, although not in a talkative niosiner. He complimented the last speaker on his piece of stonewalling, undertaken to keep the ball rolling until the Ministry had their number in the House. The result, which was now a foregone conclusion, was due to the twisting and turning of some of the political jugglers, who werv aljsolutely insincere. He did not combat the assertion that women can use as good discretion as men in returning minnbers to Parliament, but he objected to the Bill because it was the payment of the Government for the support of the Ihlxh- party. The Government had been bought cheap by the labor party, and he considered it to the interests of the colony that the machinations of the labor party should not increase. He did not think the countrv m«nbers were acting in the interests of their constituents. They had pledged themselves in times gone by to a somewhat similar measure, but that was not the case with all of them. •Some had only promised to extend the franchise on a property qualification, and they were not bound to support the Bill. The worst feature of the Bill was the extra strength it would give to voters in the towns. The Minister of tdu catiun was not sincere in the matter; he had played his own game, and would probably reap the reward before 18 months were over. Per sonal interest was at the bottom of most of the voting for the BilL JSach hon. member asked himself—""How will this affect me next election?"" (Mr. Brooker— ""Is that why you have so many polling places!"") It did not affect him personally, but he was opposed to giving the Government and the labor party extra power. His opinion was that tbe labor party are not sincere. (An hon. member—"" What about the country party f') Well, they had one or two pre \a7icaton who would not go straight. (Mr. Brooker—"" Bad whipping.'"") No, it was not. They had an exhibition of personal interest in the action of Mr. McPhersou who at 6 o'ciock ou Saturday morning said he intended to move bo as to exclude women from voting for the Legislative Council, but thu Government had evidently talked him over. He hoped ever}' member who voted for this Bill for poUticalpcrposes would be rejected at the polls. Tuo labor party was the most con servative in the House; they conserved their own interests to the detriment of every other party. Tbe basis of the legislation on which they were working was absolutely rotten, and the result would be that the colony would topple over from its own weight. The Com missioner of Crown Lands had turaeii round from his professions of last year, and the Government whip had doue the same. Some hon. members might bell their con sciences and their country for a miserable pittance on the Treasury benches— The SPEAKER—I don't think the hon. member i? in order in asserting that hon. members sell their consciences ana their coun ilr. GRIFFITHS would then say in some instances. The SPEAKER—In no instances. The hon. member must withdraw the statement unreservedly. Mr. GRIFFITHS withdrew the statement unreservedly. He could understand the other members of tbe Ministry supporting the measure, because they would do anything to increase their power. The Commissioner of Public Works wuuld support anything, especi ally since it appeared that tbe American ejigle is a benlord which lavs eggs. (The Com midouer of Public Works—""You are better up in eggs than in politics."") A democratic paper, die Sydney BulUiin, had the following letter on this subject:— ""Womanhood Suffrage. — Editor Butbtin — The modem woman is abroad and her cry fills all tiie earth. Somebody has said that woman was born to suffer and that man was born to be suffered; but the sex which in most of the animal species is classed as die weaker, and only in man attempts to pose as the stronger, is rapidly inverting this aphorism. There is now a modern woman's party, which in cludes aomts young creatures of the child bearing sex and many ok! women of both wxea. Tbe constitution of this party is peculiar. The trousers-wearing section com prises a small sprinkling of ehrewd young fellows with a political axe to grind, an advanced woman to win. or an ancient one to pleaw; many cranks and fadmongere whose special varieties of insanity are calculated to appeal rather to the emotional natures of women than to the intellects of men; clergy loen of all denominations and shades of beuef —fur by none is the power of the clicrch more firmly upheld than by those whose daily actions are alternately swayed by an ecstatic yearning for the joys of heaven, or a quivering trepidation «t the names of liejl; * few gcidai age visionaries of the Besant variety, and free thinkers of th« Bradlaugh variety; most advocates of free love and free license; and a certain proportion of cast-iron Conservatives who i-unningly guess that all democratic inno vation will be shunned by their feminine clients with more emphatic opposition than by most conwrvativv men.

There wan a lot of truth in those passagos, sud liefotv voting for the third reading he Imped members would review the position and not fcupjKwt tiie bill for die sake of satisfying a morbid cariositv. The Hon. J. rl. HOWK moved that the House do now divide. Carried. The tlurd reading was declared carried. Mr. GRIFFITHS called for a division, which resulted as follows :— AYES, 31—The Attorney-General, Treasurer, Commissiuuer of Public Works, Commissioner of Crown Lands, lions. A. Catt, G. C. Hawker. J. H. Howe, Messrs. Archibald, Ash, Batchelor, Brouker, Burgoyne, Butler, CaUiwell, Castine, Curt, Coneybei-r, F«feiter, Hooper, Honrigan, Lake. McDonald.

Blacker, Gilbert, Giles, Grainger, Hague, E. W. Hawker, Houtburg, Johnson, Kellv, Landseer, McDonald, Kiddoch. and Griffiths, (teller). A majority of 17 for the Ayes. There being the necessary statutory majority in favor of the Bill, the third reading was carried and the Bill passed. LOAN BILL. Second reading. The THKASURER (Hon. P. W. Holderi in moving the second reading, 6aid the total in the Bill was £300,000 less than thu Govern ment asked for iu the first instance, and if the authority sought in the Bill were given there would be uo necessity for a Loau Bill next session, and unless works ware authorised the Govemnuiit would be able to get through the succeeding session also. There were two de partures trow the ordinary form in the Bill. The first was in respect to the issue of bonds in lieu of inscribea stock. Members would remember that three years ago a portion of the ISSKI stock was sold to the Savings Bank. There was an engagement with theTreasurer of the day (the Hon. T. Playford) tliat the bank was to lm permitted to take up bonds in lieu of stock, and tliat the interest was to be pay able iu Adelaide instead of London, and pro vision was made in clause 8 for the issue of bonds iustead of stock. The other alteration was in clause 2, in which it was provided that in lieu of issuing a loan for a fixed period, say of SO yearti, the Government could issue it for a faxed period of not less than ten years, with the right to repay it at any time after the expiry of the ten years. At the same time the Go vernment did not bind themselves down to ten years, and if the House desired they v-ould not be averse to increasing the term. Ten years would not interfere with the Government getting a good price for the stock, but the whole question was open to argument. He moved the second reading. Mr. GRAIXGER moved the adjournment of the debate. Negatived. Mr. GRAINGER called for a division, which resulted as fol lows:— Ayes, 13—The Hon. Sir John Downer, Messrs. Calduvll, Castine, Gilbert, Giles, Griffiths, Hague, E. W. Hawker, Homburg, Johnson, McDonald, Kiddooh, and Grainier (teller). Noes, 31—The Attorney-General, (Commis niissioner of Public Works, Minister of Edu cation, Commissioner of Crowu Lands, Hons A. Catt, G. C. Hawker. J. H. Howe, Messrs. Arcliiluld, Ash, Batchelor, Blacker, Brooker, Burgoyne, Butler, Cock, Coneybeer, Foster, Hooper, Hourigan. Laadseer, McGillivray, MacLachlan, McPherson, O'Loughlin, Poyn ton, Price, Randell, Scherk, Short, Wood, and die Treasurer (teller). Majority of 18 for the Noes. Mr. GRAINGER said he was reminded of the old saying, ""Fools rush in where angels fear to tread? The Bill, wet from the printer, contained entirely new principles with regard to borrowing money, and members had not been given time to read it. There was room for entire reform in our Parliament At a critical period like the present care should be exercised in dealing with the finances, but members who talked for hours about the reduc tion of a pound in the salary of a Civil ser vant seemed to be disposed to rash through authority to Ixhtow a million of money. It was monstrous. The measure ought to have been brought forward months ago. When the Estimates were under consideration hours were devoted to the consideration of a forage allowance to a Civil servant, but when a million was involved the question was rushed through. The question had not been discussed, and he objected to the House being treated in such a manner. With reference to the Savings Bank members would remember that the bank requested bonds instead of stock, and it was questionable whether Mr. Playford had any right to sell bonds to the bank. (The Treasurer—"" He did not give them bonds. He made an arrange ment subject to the approval of Parliament.'') The Government and their supporters bad wasted time which ought to have been devoted to this Loan BUL The Govern ment called the long speeches of their iriends legitimate discussion, and stigma tised the shorter utterances of opponents as stonewalling. The Government had brought forward measures which they never thought of carrying, and he strongly condemned their action in thus frittering away valuable time. The Loan Acts of 1890 and 1H92 contained no reference to bonds, and the clause relating to bonds in the Bill was entirely new. There was a good deal of confusion with regard to the words ""stock"" and ""bonds,"" and these were often used as if they had the same meaning, but that was a mistake. Stock was like money deposited at call in a bank, for as on.-could drawn cheque for the whole or any portion of the amount of money he had in a bank, so oou! a holder of stock sell any portion of the stock standing to his credit in the books. Bonds were like bank notes and payable to bearer. The invest ing public did not want bonds, but the Savings Bank wanted bonds, for the bank invested large sums of money. He would draw attention to clause 2 of the Loan Act of 1892, which was as follows:— ""All stock sold pursuant to this Act shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding £3 10s. per centum per ""?""■"""". to be paid half-yearly. The principal of Mich stock shall be paid at a rate to be fixed at the time of sale, and not lass 1 than 25 yean and not more than five ywt after the time of sale. Both ntjnciptl and interest shall be payable in Tj&tim and in Adelaide."" Clause 2 of the Act?i*lS9o ran thus:—""All stock sold pur suant to this Act shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding £3 10a. per centum per annum, to be paid half-yearly. The principal of Euch stock shall be paid at a date to be fixed at the time of sale, and not being less than 25 Tears nor more than 50 years after the time of sale. Both principal and interest shall be payable in London."" The clause in the present Bill said:— "" AH such bonds or stock shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding £3 10s. per centum per annum, to be paid naif-yearly. The principal oi such bonds or stock shall be payable at a date to be fixed at the time of sale, and not being leas than ton years after the time of sale, and on and after that date shall be redeemable at par in all or by instalments at the option of the Treasurer, after not lees than six months' notice to the holder in die London Gazette, the London Timet newspaper, and the Small Australian CorernmaU Gazette. Both principal and interest shall be payable in London or in Adelaide. 1* It would be noticed that in both the former Acts and in this BUI the rate of interest was restricted to 34 per cent. When £100 worth of SJ par cent, stock was sold for £90 it brought the rate of interest up to about 3$ per cent. If 3 per cent, stock were floated at a reasonable rate it would be better for the Government. It would be a good change if dividends were paid quarterly, as in the nor of consols. Even members of that HtHWff liked to get their mil rim monthly, and so have the opportunity of investing their money properly, and certainly one would pre fer to get one's dividends quarterly rather than half-yearly. It would undoubtedly be better to provide for the payment of interest quar terly rather than half-yearly. Although the interest which we had to pay was not due till June 30 it was the practice of the Treasurer to provide for the payment of it every quarter. He was altogetfasr opposed to the term ""ten years alter tune of saleI'in the clause dealing with the matter. Where a loan was at a premium and was redeemable at par the lender knew that he would lose so much of bis rT""?™p?l If the loan were at a dis count he would gain additional interest and also redeem some of his principal. When did members expect this colony to repay the debt* (Mr. Hamburg—""After 10 years.' 1) What was the use of **""*m?**ff die right to redeem in 10 years if d?e insertion of such a condition meant that the colony would get a lower price. He maintained that irredeemable stock should not be issued redeemable in so short a period, so that investors would know that we could not disturb them. The stock should also be redeemable at die option of the Government, and not of the in vestor. (The Treasurer—""Precisely what is provided for here."") He was glad that the Government had accepted the -dea, because he did not think there was much chance of the colony repaying the loan for years to come. If we could wipe off our debt of £23,000,000 in 23 years, or even 66, we would have done much better than many members expected now. It was a mistake to have 3J per cent, stock, as it would be much preferable to consolidate our loans at 3 per cent. We would have to issue stock at a discount, but the experience of other countries proved that S per cent, stock rf>nunartdftd a comparatively higher market than 3) or 4 per cent. (Mr. Homburg—"" Especially if we can repurchase at par."") Exactly. Would it not be advisable liefore we went in for more borrowing to «nn«nliH?i« our debt, and thus save some £60.000 or £70,000 annually 1 The Government should pl^M* i-h""*** f w.w??i>.i pro posals much sooner before the House, instead of leaving them to the end of the Gcsdion. All that they had done 6O far had been to add to the taxation of the people, instead of saving their pockets in anyway. The .Government had refused to carry on re productive public works unless they would yield 6 per cent., but at the same time they proposed to borrow a large sum to expend on roads which would give no direct return to the revenue. He maintained that clauses 2 and 3 would mean a waste of public money because the Treasurer would not be able to go on the market on such favorable terms as he might otherwise da The Treasurer had stated that tb4 policy of die Government was one Loan Bill in three years, but vet pointed to the Acts of 1690 and 1832L both* of which were for larger amounts than, the present BOL (The Treasurer —"" The present Government were not in office then."") Some of the Ministry were in office, however. (The Treasurer —""Four at least were not, and I am not quite sure whether five were not."") He would ask the labor party what they thought of the proposal of the Government, seeing that there were to be no new public works authorised, while a large amount of the present loan was to pay for pastoral improvements. Clause 3 contained the words, ""and the principal to be paid on the first day of the tint day of in the year one thousand nine hundred and . . . ."" That blank would have to be filled in before the form was signed or it would be illegal; so that after all the loan was to be redeemable. That was the result of copying obsolete Acts. Clauses 4, 5, 6, and 7 were the usual stock clauses, except that in No. 4 the word "" bonds"" was got nd of. Clause 8, which was new altogether, set out:—""The Treasurer may raise such portion of the loans authorised by 'The Public Purposes Loan Act, 1890,' and ""The Public Purposes Loan Act, 1892,' as he shall think proper by the issue and sale of bonds instead of by the issue and sale of inscribed or registered stock, and such bonds may be in the form herein before provided, and euch bonds shall bear interest at the rate of £3 10s. per centum per annum, to be paid half-yearly, and the prin cipal shall be paid at a date of 45 years from the date of sale, and both principal and interest shall be payable in Adelaide or in London."" That he supposed was to give power to the Treasurer to deal with the Savings Bank, which ho maintained should not be done under the present Bill, but the principle should be introduced in a separate measure. It was cumbersome, and people in England not having the long explanation of the Treasurer would not understand it. Were the Savings Bank to take the stock at the average price raised? (The Treasurer—""Certainly."") That was with regard to the loan of 1890—(the Treasurer —""Yes"">—and not with regard to that of 1892. (The Treasurer — ""No."") If the Treasurer would introduce a separate Bill dealing with the subject he would do all he could to assist him in passing it. He would, however, make another suggestion under which that would not be necessary. In the first place he did not believe in provisions for sinking funds, as he had lost faith in them, because they were generally merely book entries. The experience of England had proved that sinking funds did not work out as people expected. They could not be regulated, and investments could not be found for them until there was an opportunity of repaying the loan for which they were raised. It was much better to borrow cheaply and repay the debt on which there was heavier interest. The system of terminable annuities was better even than that. England found a great advantage in these annuities. The TREASURER moved the suspension of the sitting for an hour. Carried, and at 1 o'clock p.m, the House sdjounied till 2 p,m. Mr. GRAINGER said if we borrowed a. mil lion on 30 years' annuities at the end of the term we would not be liable for a penny. This was much more satisfactory than the ginl-irnj fund system. Daring the nest few years we had millions to pay back, and we bad no ginlrinff fund to meet them. Annuities would bind the colony down to pay so much. per year, and at the end of the term the in debtedness would be wiped out We should first of all consolidate our debt Another scheme was that instead of interfering with the Savings Bank the Government might establish a Post-Omce Savings Bank, and les people deposit money as in the Savings Bank, or when the amount reached a pound the depositors if they wished would receive 3 per cent, stock in the same way as the French Government issued 3 per cent. rentes. The Government institution could run side by side with the Savings Bank, and die best managed institution would receive the patronage .of the public This would prevent the sending away of such a heavy sum annually as interest. England was the money-lender of the world, and the borrower had as usual become the servant of the lender. In Newfoundland a, panic had quite recently been caused; and England had agreed to assist on condition t&afc a Commission should be allowed to go oat and enquire into the matter. England was conquering the world by means of her money power. Egypt had been seized because she did not pay the British investor his dues. The Post-Ofiice Savings Bank would please the people and allay any suspicion with regard to the Savings Bank. Some people had Tery improperly tried to get up a run on the Savings Bank; and no terms were too hard for those who tried to frighten the depositors because they disapproved of the Government policy. He was (dad to see that the deposits in the Savings Bank were keeping . so healthy in spite of this. It was not fair of the Government to ask hon. members to go on with a BUI they had had no time to consider. Clause 8, and the whole part relating to bonds, should be taken out and brought down in another measure. Clause 8 said:— "" The Treasurer may raise such portion of the loons, authorised by 'The Public Purposes Loam Act, 1890,'and 'The Public Purposes Loan Act, 189%' as hefihaH think proper, by the is?ue and sate of bonds instead of by the issue and sale of inscribed or registered stock, and such bonds maybe in the form herein- , before provided, and each bonds shall bear interest at the rate of three pounds ten shillings per per «ymm} r to be paid half-yearly, and the principal shall be paid ac a date of forty-five years from the date of sale, and both principal and interest shall be pay', able in Adelaide or in London."" Now, tie stock authorised by die Act of 1890 had been issued, and of that authorised in 1892 there was only £3LL279 remaining. The amount of - stock held by die Savings Bank, which they ' asked the Treasurer to turn into bonds, was £532,900, so that the remaining £311,O(>0 would' not be enough. It would not be advisabietc ■'. repeal die LoanAct of 1892, but to take die - '. amount out of die present T*v«i Ttffi ..- . or to adopt die course of having a separate .

At the proper time he would jnoveto reduce the total to £575^470, as be thought that tha items beyond railways and waterworks should be charged to a.separate minimi. ■ - > Mr. BUTLER, pointed out that with tha Hxoeptinn of about £160,000 ft* the Beetaloo waterworks nearly all dte items in the fiohpriuto ; wen works that had teen authorised by Par liament, in certain mstanryp some years ago.

It most be •• remembered that money was very easuV pro curable in England as was shown in the in stance of the fiossan loan of 15 mining which was subscribed for .SO times over. It was surely more difficult to raise money foe Russia than for South Australia, where die security must be regarded as better. There was no present necessity' to borrow die amount asked for by the Treasurer for p?gh?~i improvements, for ?l«w iraK still X. pnoat^Hty r* lcg«J«tfng>-fr? ■ - get rid of something ■Uka a fair proportion of those liabilities. It could not be denied that* very great mistake was made mreoommending die payment for those improvements in d? - first instance. Oar railways were mot paying - extremely well, and that it was inadvisable to , increase dte rolling-stock more than was . unavoidable. He would cite the remarks of various members on this subject. The Hon. T. Playford in.lB9osaid:—""The Railway Commissioneissaiddtat die increased rolling-stock was absolutely necessary in con sequence of growing requirements. They anticipated that the Broken TTfll traffic; alone would be doubled. At present the Com missioners had the greatest difficulty with the inadequate rolling-stock to meet the traffic They expected that they would require all die additional stock, and he hoped that the House ■ would agree to dte vote. (Mr. Holder— 'Is any of die rolling-stock inten ded to replace worn-out rolling-stock ?)"" Mr. Copley in IS9O said:—""The increaseaf traffic was going on at such a rate that new engines and carriages and waggons must be provided. The largest amount was for in creased locomotive power. * The hon. gentle man read the items comprising this amount. , (Hon. W. K. Simms—"" Do you want that all this yearf) No, that would be extended over three years. (""All new."") Ves, it was all for new stock, and £236,000 had been anticipated.'' It «bs said that the original cast of ihe Beetaloo works would be £250,000, but it had crept up to £750,000, whilst in reality tha work could easily have been done for £500,000. In 1885 Sir John Downer said—""As to die Beetaloo scheme hon. members knew that die source of die supply was in the Wirrabara forest reserve, and that water would thence be supplied to Gladstone and Laura and Hba Peninsula. The supply.stored in the proposed reservoir in Rocky Valley would be nothing in comparison with that expected to be stored in Bamma. The oast of die -storage of die water would be £130,000, and the cost of carry ing it to Gladstone, Laura, and dte Peninsula would be £130,000, or a total of £330,000."" Sir John Bray in 1886 said—""Hon. mem bers would be aware that last year two reports from die Hydraulic Engineer with reference to - the Beetaloo waterworks wexe laid before die House. In die first die estimated cost was considerably higher than in die second, when a closer inspection had been made. The House had agreed to die first instalment of £SO,OOO for die work, and he understood that die entire ?? Bt}*Jl I%£ 1.* 0? tUe branches, would be £350,000, but he was happy to say thati as the work progressed the Hydraulic Engineer estimated that die cost would be someihin? like £200,000. This arose from the difference in the mode of constructing the works. He had obtained a report from die Hydraulio Engineer showing the progress of die work uo Xto the end of June last, when, as shown in Loan Estimates, die expenditure was about £32,000. The actual expenditure up to October, including all die material purchased, was about £73,000, and in addition to tha* diere was an amount of £15,000 for cement. The Hydraulio Engineer went on:—My original estimate was £260,000 for die dam, head works, and main pipe lines, but did not include any provisions for branch pipes or subsidiary dis tributing mains. The works have been in pro gress 10 months, and d?e low rate at which they have been constructed up to die present time fully justify me in reducing the estimate to £200,000. The branch and distributinir mains cannot be definitely decided until after the present summer, when their number and direction may be determined, but it is probabla that die cost will not exceed £60,000 to £70,000."" Those remarks were certainly worthy of note. He would support die second read ing, voting to reduce die total amount in committee. Mr. HOMBURG said it needed no apology from any member to address die Howii oa any part of the Jjoajj £01, He W^. Continued on Page

(Mr. MarTmrWan —""The French femnvn support them."") France waa & wonderfully wealthy country, and there would never be any ddficuttar in ww^^y netaoos willing to in vest in its securities. Having bad eo little time to consider the principle which the Go vernment bad for the first time introduced be was dimirfhwd to share in any responsibility in advising the Government to adopt the ■svstemof intermediate bonds or to maintain that of inscribed stock. It most be a risk, and if it failed be would not blame the Treasurer, while if it Succeeded the Treasurer could not take much credit to himself, because it would beaflnke. HtheTreasurerhadisufficientfaithin intetimnahlfr bonds he thought he should float by their means the money authorised under the Acts of 1890 and 1892. (The Treasurer— ""There is no balance of the 18S0 loan."") Then in committee be would ask the Treasurer to at least take power to raise the balance of the 1893 loan by this means. (The Treasurer—""lt would mix up things terribly. 1') It wonld make no difference, as the Treasurer conld appropriate that £300,000 which he had still to float to one particular loan work, and thus remove the whole of the difficult*-. He made the suggestion with a view of fn*Sljt«*'""g the work oFthe Treasurer and of removing the fear of compulsory repayment in respect to that amount exactly as he wished to remove it from future Treasurers in respect to the pro posed new loan, leaving them to provide the interest and Hie repayment of the loan at then own option. It would be seen by the schedule that the Treasurer required £200,000 far the panMees of railwavs. but according to the state of works in ptugman in 1891-5 there ven sums unexpended amounting to about £1,000,000. The only information they had 1 with vespect to that 'amount iras that it would be required for works al ready authorised. (The Treasurer—""That amount has been voted- by Parliament for specific works."") They were told that that turn would be required to complete works, bat .that was not quite accurate, because they knew ' that so long as the Engineer-in-Chief had a com still available works were raid for out of loan instead of out of revenue. (The Treasurer ; — ""Never."") They had the best illustration of that as pointed out by Mr. Giles in the wash aways. (The Treasurer—""They are provided for out of revenue."") Mr. Giles had re ferred to the fact that the washaway of bridges, which were works of reconstruction, had been paid for out of loan. (The Treasurer—""Certainly not"") He would ask the Treasurer to see whether it was not true that Sir John Downer had contemplated the tranter to loans of certain earns concern ing which there was doubt whether thev belonged to loan or revenue, and which had •since been transferred by the present Govern ment. (The Treasurer—"" We transferred none.'') Hb would further discuss the point at committee. {The Treasurer—""l spoke at come length on these points the other night/1) The Treasurer ooold not expect members to keep the figures in their minds, and most number? did not know what the money was being actually raised for. (Mr. Poynton— '* It is for liabilities already incurred."") It was not. (The Treasurer—"" More than two-thirds,"" and Mr. CaldweD—""That shows that we want a <""?-H""i? committee. 9') Be wonld not be more prepared to take the assurance of a finance committee than he was to take the ptT+rmmt of the Treasurer. He would want to look as ranch into the work of die committee as he would into that of the Government. (Mr. Caldwrfl—""Tbe majority of the House would credit a finance committee. 1') He was pre pared to credit the Government. The question realty was whether the unexpended balances would be required to be spent* Even if the money were required it wonld be frittered away in unnecessary -works. Lines which had been completed eight or nine years should be treated as finished, and the unexpended balance should be transferred to some other fond, if possible to that for carrv ing out the railway works proposed, as be did not think that they should add to that . £1,000,000 another £300.000. Then there was £463,894 unexpended and stul available for the development of the interior. Had the Treasurer got that money? If be had he did not think it was necessary to raise another £300,000. (The Treasurer ""Of the &,«90,000 under that head £460,000 has not been raised; £400,000 ? in stores and the balance in the banks.'} He would ask the Treasurer m explain how this mysterious sum ?? made up, ms it was evident that he was not the only one that had been misled. (The Treasurer—""lt means authority in hand sod not cash in hand. 99) Then he understood that oni of tbe maiion then was £163,000 which was .tin to be raiesd. (The Treasurer— . ""Yea.""} There were Urge balances in band for railways wiicfa had been finished for yean, and' why not transfer them to other fines instead of leaving them in the hand* of the. Treasurer to be disposed of in aey wanner without tbe authority of the Hossn. i= committee he would once more aeafl himirif of the opportunity to hare wave ♦jefinae iimhtrtmiting from the Treasurer** fa>what?ae!?be *?e with the unexpended balances. Wita regard to the line of £379,000 . vfaich was K* down for waterworks he did not Sunk, they -could avoid casing it, although perhaps if they were to cntacaDy «■*""""""■«. the amount it might be said to be a •rifle larger than t£e Treasurer had shown any necessity far. Waterworks, however, wens somewhat indefinite line, inasmuch as they wen always extending the aiua within wna* the water was to be supplied from year to year, and they were about the most repro docove public work which tbeState had under tafem with the exeeptna of the waterworks in the«Sstricte represented by Messrs. CaMwell, Howe, Grainger, Poynton, and Burgoyne. Itwaa a angular fact that the members for Gladstone always got a Bora on die Loan Entrwatat for either the Beetatoo works or for deepening Port Pirie, and that if thev did not they immfriiatery went into opposition. With regard to the Use for harbor im provements he noticed that there «s a proposed expenditure of seven! thousands at Port Pirie, and he would lrke to know whether it could not be stopped? (Tbe Treasurer—""By the end of this yeer it win be all spent-"") Were they going on for ever dredging this miserable mndbple, or would dais com he the final amount'! (The Treasurer —""I hope it will be."") He was afraid that that nope was vain. It would bo far better to Jet-Port Bade silt up, and spend the money at Pot Germena, where they had aa open roadstead and a splendid jetty. A railway or tramway line could be constructed to cany the produce to Port Germein, or if they must have water traffic they could ntifae barges. The money spent at Port Augusta, however, had been exceedingly well-laid oat, as he considered it a natural port in every sense. He did not begrudge the expenditure there, and he only wished that its ttade was a little more prosperous, and thai ' the Government could see their way clear to give additional facilities for paste al purposes, which would make Port Augusta one of the finest ports in Australia. With regard to the oatports, it was proposed to borrow £3,000, although only £200 was required at Streaky Bay and Wallaroo. Thev had £6,000 unexpended in connection with Port Adelaide which alight be temporarily trans • forred. (The Treasurer—'-We most not en dorse that sort of thing."") They knew that it was frequently done, and the Treasurer had set a good example in that direction. He would ask the Treasurer to give more infor mation in committee with regard to the Fowler's Bay jetty. If Fowler's Bay was the settlement he had heard it was, a jetty would be wanted, and as £3,700 was not a very Urge amount for such a propose he would support the vote. _ The next item was the defence vote, and he desired information about the amount of £2,470 wanted tor the defences of Thursday. Island The Treasurer said possibly the money would not be wanted, at any rate until the other colonies had performed their agreement for the defence of Port Darwin. If the amount mere not required there would be an unex pended balance of £7,733, but he did not think that amount or the amount of £2,670 for Thursday Island would be wanted, heranne the other colonies would never subscribe a brass farthing towards the. defence of the cable at Port Darwin. There was no doubt Queensland had treated South Australia, very badly indeed, as though she had neglected to contribute towards the defence ot"" die cable. South Australia had provided that colony for the last ten years with the whole of itscaWegrams. .Though Queensland benefited ,to a much larger extent than South Aus tralia from the Eastern Extension Cable Company's cable service, she had per sietently refused to contribute anything towards it. There was no leason therefore to give a colony of that sort any i?sistanm in the shape of Hpffflices, and he would ask the Treasurer to strike out the item for the defences of Thursday Island. He noticed a statement that the West Australia.!) Government contemplated terminating the contract under which the defence of Albany was undertaken, and in committee he would . ask if there was any likelihood, of West Aus tralia going back on its contract. The Treasurer wanted £5,000 for drainage in . the south-east, bat the amount in tended to be expended was £3,638. It was not desirable for the Government to .' borrow more money than was actually required ,jfer public works. In the past that had been but he would ask the Treasurer tocou ,-?^t to a redaction in that line, He was pleased ' that the committee had determined to reduce ■"". <ne amount of £400,000 for pastoral improve ments to £200,000, and that might cause the Government to reconsider, earlier than other wise they ought have done, the question '. of pastoral legislation. Before the Govern , sent had spent the £200,000 he hoped ■ they would see that the necessity for a , new Loan Bill for money to pay for unprove , zoents could be averted by adopting ' more liberal pastoral legislation. In deal . .;>Bg with pastoral lfgwlation the Go ; ferameat rfteajLd not commit the error rji^mtJ&J* *?S*J"" 3*? >rt«tf- of members were not disposed to allow any radical change in pastoral legislation, so far as Class I. country was concerned. Future legislation should deal with the reduc tion of rents for Class I. country, in deserving cases, leaving all other matters concerning Class L country as at present. In re gard to Glas3 n. and 11L country they should try to do something to induce pastoral lessees to forego all claims for i>astoral improvements, so that Loan Bills to pay for them might become unnecessary. Mr. HAGUE said Mr. Grainger was fully justified in ?sHt?g for an ad journment of the debate, asthe 'Bill was only placed oefore them that morning and the particulars with regard to Loan Estimates were only laid on the table on the day that the Treasurer moved for leave to introduce the B3L They should have had at least a a week to consider matters of such importance. They were indebted to Mr. Grainger for the able speech he had delivered, and he regretted that members had not had the opportunity of considering it Mr. Homburg taid that'the new departure with regard to the bonded stock was an experiment, and they did not know whether it would be a success or not. He referred to clause 2, under which the Treasurer had power given him to redeem bonds after ten years, the reason for the insertlDu of that pro vision bein? that it was possible the rate of interest might fall, and that the Treasurer should have the opportunity of redeeming stock. But the priue given for stock would not be so much whi-n the purchasers knew it would only run forten years. They had now a consider able amount of stock on which they paid G, 5, and 4 per cent, interest, and it woold take them all they could do during the coming ten years to redeem that stock without making &ny provision for the reduction of the stock referred to in the Bill. He did not understand clause 8 and would want more information about it. He could not understand it if it were retrospective, as the power given for the future could not affect anything done in the past. He had said before that considerable reductions could be made in the Loan Estimates, and he -eras glad that £200,000 was struck off from pastoral improvements. Mr. Homburg had mentioned the balances to vrhich he had himself referred tbe other day, but the Treasurer said he proposed to bring in a transfer Bill next session and then the money could he used for the south-eastern drainage works. That money, however, was borrowed for railway purposes, and if the Treasurer were consistent in the stand he had taken it could be only used for railway purposes. The Treasurer had promised to give him information in reference to the amount for railway accommodation, and liis action with regard to that lino would largrfr dr-pend on the explanation he received from the Trea surer. He had voted against th? construction of the Happy Valley works, but it \ras aheurd to propose, as Mr. Butlett did, that those works fehould be stopped and the money spent elsewhere. Since the monev had been bor rowed acd the work had been com menced, it would have to be completed. The case u-as different with regard to the Beetaloo works. On June 3d they had £24,083 in hand on the Beetaloo account, and it was a question of policy whether they should spend a larger sum than that or Dot. The Government proposed to spend £125,000 to extend the reticulation to within a mile and a half of the holdings of the various set tlers. Last session the Treasurer, then Com missioner of Public Works, pointed out that if they did that they woulcf only get a return of 2 per cent., while the money ex pended would cost 4 per oeat., eu that tbe genera! taxpayer would have to pay that extra 2 per cent lor the benefit of the people who obtained water from Beetaloo. rtu-rewere several items provided under the head of "" rural industries"" which he did not believe in, and they could reduce the amount to twenty or thirty thousands pounds. He would Dot oppose the eecond reading of the Bill, but in com mittee be would endeavor to make several alte rations. Mr. CALDWELL had listened carefully to the brief statement of the Treasurer, and with pkssurc to the exhaustive KpsK-b of Mr. Grainger, whom he complimented on hi? masterly address. He regretted that th? re porting had not bwn eo satisfactory as they woobluke; probably <m account of the late sittings, end because the contract had bneji taken too low, so that a Bavin? nt bring effected by curtailing the length of ef wcci**. He regretted that such was the case, not w> much m the interest* of the public a* in tin inbatsUof members, who iiLui to hart the men who looked deeply into these maru-rs carefully reported. ProbaUy Mr. Grain^vr wodld be fully repartfd. lit hoped ht> would be. But on another occasion be Lad noticed a fairly exhaustive speech given by Mr. Hague cot down into a very f baft um. The less said about the Government proposals the better, as they vrxe only repeating the artiam of previous y«ars. Mr. Homtwrg and Mr. Hague and Mr. Moule had com* to tbe condutsiun that tbe amount proposed to Ui expanded waa too much, but be «w disp>jaed to support the Govercnrent. A •uuunitu** of finance, similar to that appointid uihJpt Im perial legislation and in America, was wanted to do justice both to the House and u> th? country, asj now members «rw? largtrlv in the hands of tint Treaeunrr of titu day. Perhaps punning better arrangementa it k-u well for the rchptmailttlity to iwt on thv Trea surer, even though na-abers might ha.\~ th«r own opinion* with ngard t/i t5?- amounts ;jr? poHsd to be spent. Mr. Graincer raid that our Lians must be cousmiidatu^ acd mesas taken to secure* a linking fund i'tr ibn redaction of a <Mjr. that was steadily proaiufr. aad iv r--f-rr.fl to tin' work of the J'ublio IVlrt CorauiiBM<jn->r> sppointnd by tliu Jtu[??ri?l l>tr>tlla;<uv.

Wp cocM nut do better tlian follow such a good example. The eritabliiihmmt of a GoAtnunent Savings Bank fcb< aild at otkt be acoomplisbed. They had w<>rk<xl well in tbe other colonies and in Kngiaod. He aprt-wl with Mr. Grauigerthat the oalaries on the Loan Ritimatea are of equal icparUune Ut thoev ua the ordinary ba!*cce->>heri. Titty had ci^de no provtion for il&Ki.-ng tue existing surplus labor. He tnciv of no eewion where less v-at done in that dihAJtion and he had never eves mure aVLe-budied men wazidfrinj aliout liis ■iL-ni-t ami in the city. Jt was true * JovernniMit w:urities are everywhere eotiylit alter, and it proved w?ot of cuo&dence in (ir?VK?>- itn t>?au«-ots, and the time would come when tli<- diotm^t vrould spread to Government seosiritie^. He woul'l rather see the many at a liv;n_- wage than tee the many out of work and thf ffw at hi^'h wagws. 'The Government had livlpKl to demoralise society by tlte expenditure of l'?u money in high sabtnes. He ?an glad the 1 Tn employtd Commission had lieeti a{>poiuted in tbe other House. He had m de?ri- to tee tbe working man reduced to •-iiryiuitu*'. but be saw the producers in bis district working for practically nothing. li<> <lid not übjvct to inUanunable bonds even if it was an<""??xppri ment. A gentleman had told - Liui tin- Treasurer could get all the ioon>y in the colony if it was not placed' too rapidly on the market. Tlic nrra wuich that gentieman represeatwl «w Killiiu V> take a quarter of a million. He at&uiijd tlif Trea surer that the time must come wheu gr&tcr attention would have to be paid to the finances of tbe colony. He had asked different Trea surers to adopt a new standard for conducting business—call it a. State Bank or a reformed Treasury. We must iiavt; ciieaper money in order to compensate for the fall in prices of staple produce.. As to the Beetaloo and Onka paryign water schemes he was not surprised to learn that the first had cost about a million and that the same amount would have to be speut at Happy Valley. He regretted the bad effect the latter would have on the producers— men who had provided themselves with water at great cost, and who would uon- be cut out by men who would get water at a cheaper rate. Mr. MOULE regretted that the Treasuier had uot put the position of the loan fund accurately before the Chamber. At the rime the Treasurer moved the resolution for going into a Committee of Ways and Means the necessary information was not before faon. members. (The Treasurer—""l gave full in formation when I spoke on the resolution.""} Oh, no. The Treasurer had stated that he had £83,000 in hand for pastoral improvements, but he forgot to state that there was £159,000 avail able out of the Act of 1892. Out of six items on the Loan Bill of 1892 four had (wen taken into account, and £10,000 for buildings. Look ing at the amount expended out of loan fund pending flotation of a new loan they found that £47,'J38 had been taken out of loan account. When they came to examine the Treasurer's figures they found tliu proposal to recoup the loan fund of SAH.lth, a. difference of £9GS. The Treasurer might surely as well have made provision for this £WB. The figures of the Couumstdoners of Audit were also misleading. On page 3.1 of their report they said that the actual cash balance of the loan fund was £1,133,21?. That was ia correct to the extent of £163,750. (The Trea surer—"" You ought not, out of your ignorance, to make charges like thst."") The Treasurer was very rude, and the Treasurer knows what he Mr. Moule is saying is correct. The amount of the balance in hand of the loan receipts and payments on June 30, 1891, was £1,133,219 2s. &L Tbe Treasurer had taken out of the loan fund the sum of £103,750 to recoup revenue; against it he liuld the authority to float Treasury bills to that extent, so that the actual cash balance in hand was £969,469. The Commissioners of Audit preferred to put it in the way men tioned, and the Treasurer objected. They said that instead of a surplus of £1,000 at the doss of last year there was £164,000 deficit The report of the Com missioners gave the balance of loans as £1,1H1,157, tut this was misleading, because the money was not there by half a million. Taking the figures as shown, and deduct ing the amount which might be issued! as Treasury hills, the ai.-tual halance in! hand was £969,4ti9. The Treisurer had) authority to float the balance of the loan of 1892 amounting to ££*i,289; also authority to float Treasury bills to the extent of £1<3,750=£560,039, giving the Treasurer a capital on paper of £1,529,5>)8. He proposed to expend during 1894-5 £636,281, leaving an apparent balance in favor of the Treasury on June 30, 1816. of £903,227. These figures differed somewhat from those he quoted on last Friday, but he had not then had time "" to them closely. The balance on Juno 30, 1893, was £903,227. Tiie loan balance on June 30, 1594, was £1,181,157, while the balance of the 1892 loan came to £39G.251, making a total of £1,577,390. The proposed expenditure for £1894-5 was £030,281, which left the remainder £951,115, ■while the new loan of £U3y,. rio9 brought the amount up to £1,590,G15. lie did not alto- Sther believe in the Treasurers balances, e was afraid that they were very like bank balances—very much on paper. Two thinss had to be reckoned in connection with the loan balance, which wss stated to be nearly a million. Against that, however, must be placed £400,001) for tbe storus account and the indebtedness of the Northern Territory, which came to £300,000, and might eventually reach £400,000. Those were impor tant facts and deserved consideration. The development of the interior—that was a mstter which should be very carefully thought over. The Bill, generally,"" would liave been bettor if the Treasurer had taken the Houw. into his confidence, for members were certainly entitled to more parricalar? than those which he had given. They must remember that the late Treasurer had promised to give the trustees of the Savings Bank bonds in ex change for t-took, and .in explanation should have been furnished on that point. Tiiequestion of the conversion of the public debt was an important one, and it demanded tht best and most cartful thought of the House. Thet'.o vemment should have paid more attention to that matter. It must be borne in mind that the number of unemployed was considerable, and that women for the most part were more anxious about their husbands and brothers securing work than on the question of the franchise. It was a grave subject, demand ing earnest attention. There was not a single day's employment in the Government Bills on the notice-paper or passed into law. Mr. GILBERT agreed with other members that tbe fullest information should be given on en important a subject as the loan fund. It appeared to him that the Treasurer should have supplied further particulars. In the pa&t our experience had shown us that aiou>y had been borrowed too easily, and public works had been constructed in apieuumeal fashion that was to be regretted. The Treasurer teemed to think thkt members had the financ<al position of the colony at their fingers ends, but that trao a mistake, and tbe Treasurer tjiuuld not haw brought wich an important matt>r before a. thin House at a late hour of the night. That was not fair. The position phould be ex plained when there was a full attendance. He was SAxiouK that we should have the fulU«t in formation on tbe subject of the public expendi ture from loans. It was wrong to go in for public works expenditure and not to provide the uionry to pay for it- We should have a tiftiliilff estimate fu> to tbe cost of all public workx U-fore taking action. In tiii. -ciatu-r we pursued too much of a pieortiie*! policy. >Tot onlv this Government.

MrT LANIKSEKK said after they had sifted the objections against the liili it would cpix-ar as chougu tlie GuviTnment were not rw-ponsihfe for the majority of the Hims, s& they had been expended faome tiine ago. It would be unwise not to allow the Treasurer tx> make iwovUiou to meat tlitirt lintti and to take advantage of the cheap money laarki't. Tbpy wore cnui mitv.-d to the construction of the additional engines and tn the Happy Valley water works. They could not therefore blani-; tUe Trwu-uiw, at he luis c>uly uia>it' due proviiioii for the money as it would be wjnt«d. He agreed with Air. A>U that it would be vriber to })lace fuller information in the schedule, Ix-cause as the liuet> ttooJ they were ini.""lea/iiii£. They could not exi>ect to have all the facilities we possewx*! without in curring a debt. It f>tmt<i that tfien- ua-~a mile of railway constructed for «u!i per&ou in thu colony, and aa railways had' cost about £7,000 a mile each individual had a credit to that amount. With such a heavy exDeuditure it was Euriiising tliat we liad been able to pay the interest £-0 well as we had. The outlook was s*> dark that it made members diary about inerva&ing our indebtiilnesa, ajtbuugii he thought it would be necessary to float another loan eo as not to baaipur thu Go vernment. Most of the money was lor debts that had been alreadyoontracted, and he was sure that no one would suggest rej>udiali'jii for a moment. It was, however, necessary to c xmomise as far as possible, and much had already Ixxn done in this direction. If it had not ham for the extraordinarily low prices of our produce this state of tilings would not have come about, but he had every hope of better times in the future. Sir. RIIJDOCH taid all comuiercial men when entering into an undertaking always con sidered whether it was likely to pay or not, and it should be the same with the Ktate. He had no sympathy with those who decried the colony, but at the same time they should be cautious iu borrowing. He was pleased that members had taken the interest in die Bill that they liad, as he was afraid at one time that they would let it get through without much consideration. The proposals of the Govern ment were not so satisfactory as they should be. Tbe amount of unexpended balances in hand on railways, including the Loan Act of 1892, was £3G5,333, while the amount proposed to be epent, including rolling-stock, was £208,02!*, leaving a. balance in iumd of £1U9,2U4. Tliat was a Targe sum, and would do away with any necessity to borrow on account of railways. In referent* to ifce Beetaloa works toe Goveru- I iuent had a ljalance of £24,083, and they pro-1 ! |?s«l to Inmw £150,<W0. This would uiaku j I m-arly £1-<JOO,<)00 spent on the work, which j was uoi likely to return a fair imprest for tb* j outlay, and before anything mure was done they ijiould have full information as tui!i<' works tinl Government intended to go on with. The Government with the fI.W.OWJ to Ik: bor rowed and the amount in hand would liave £I!)Q,QUO available. The proposed expenditure this year was £25,00(1, and it would be well only to borrow £511,000, which, with the! amount in hand at the present rate of expendi ture would last tor three yeans. The amount of £50,000 was proposed to be borrowed for roads, but the laud owners would have to pay indirectly for it, and ite considered the amount could be considerably curtailed for the present. The indebtedness of South Australia proper amounted ta over £22,000,000 and the interest on that deljt was equal to £70 per head. Against that were the returns from public works, but there was a considerable lialaace against them in the shape of interest. The public works in South Aus tralia were paying oO""43 perctait. on the- outlay, while Victoria returned 75""10 per cent., and New toouth Wales 07 ""30 per cent. The Government might reduce the amount for the Happv Valley works l>y fifty orsixtv thousand pounds. He was glad tbe £400,VijU fur jiastoral improvements had been n.-duct-d, and it was scarcely necessary to burrow 4.'201J,000. The Government bad on hand at present iidi.ooo, and the estimated expenditure was fIOO.OW. In addition to fiXJ.oOU, the govern ment had authority to borrow £LD'J.OOO, so that the total available amount at present was £U35,0W, which wa? ample for !no yeans s«* that it was unnecessary to borrow further for that purpose. He was sorry it was neces- Bary to spend ;? much ou the yurv.-y of the land to be drained in the south-east, but the work way a mo*t im[wrtant one, and £3,000 would be enough for two years. He strongly supported two or tbreo of the items in the loan for rural indus tries, but they .should *iot burden the country whh too mucli borrowed moucy. The Hon. A. CATT said as one-or two ques tions liad cropjied up in which lie was in terested, as a member tor Gladstone he felt it his duty to say fomething. Mr. Gilbert said last week that lie rvgrett«-d bo little interest wai> manifested in the <ju<t-tioa b- .'ore them, but be considered considerable interest had been shown in discussing the ques tion. They were too apt tu tight over Moall matters and let important ones go at a run. Fault was always tontid with Government- for bringing in lasui Mile «j laU-.and yet the [«*■: tiou was oontinu.-d. The nialt.-r wa? a iu<ct important one, and a small liau-itul of jjtople, as tiny were in South Aus tralia, should ""be ran-ful about tai ling the. people with increased taxaiiou. As the Treasurer had |<uiut«d out tho bulk of the niuxH-y to be borrow«-d was roquirwl to ineet obligation* entered into by pr*-tious> y.ixilitiif*. and tiio osiuunt f.ir vhicii the present Government im rr^wiuublc wu not very Im¥«- He wat. sorry they u-.-iv burrow ing before fcomething was"" done to consolidate the puUis debt, as iu>* that man.-y was i-hcap they should make a big effort to g.-t it at a snialier rate of uit«i?-*t- H<- hoped KomcthiuK would hn <i<jn« t<> eonWi dxte vur loaus before th- H..u?- rose, u a large saving woul-i i*> then-iiy effected.

The fctoel pil?rs \\er>' adopted on the high authority of Sir. Oswald Bro?-n. and thcircost was ruduoeri some £'-S5,«iW, so thai the hon. meuilvr was trving to draw an uuwarrantabie conclusion. The pipes had ttood a very hard test, and he had yet to learn thit they were going t<i be a failure. They were giving every satisfaction at Stepheiis Creek, and he behoved we should find that at £100,000 less cost they would give us a better retnrn than iron ones. The report of the I'ublic Works Dejvurtnieut stated .---■' The £teel mains made by Kulton &. Co.. on tlie recommendation of Sir. Oswald Urovvn. havu uow buen laid for a year, and may be ixin- Hderod a great sucoess. They are a new departure in til'.' oiony, iming both che^per and ligliter than cast iron, Uut the question of durablenesa is one that can only be tested by actual ei.-perience, and we shall have to wait patiently to see the result of our ex;>erimeoL The actual cost of these mains has been £""150,'J95. and the cost of similar mains of cast iron is estimated at £*23T>.K<)t), the difference in favor of steel being ££J,005. Sir. Oswald Brown's estimate, for the steel mains was £i:W,OiW. :1 Tilt Hon. J. H. HOWE said the thanks of the House were due to Mr. Grainger for his ex cellent upeech. He srould not h&ve spoken but for the unworthy remarks of Mr. Homburg with regard to the district he had the honor to represent The fact was that every shilling sprat at Port Pint- bad been expended repro duetivcty. Not only was there a return of 4 tier cent, interest on the expenditure, but wharfs, hundreds of feet in length, and filled up cX the expense of other people, would, by the effluxion o f d>e leases, fail into the hands !of the Government, and be worth £30,000 or £40,000. The Port I'irie railway, e\ en before j the dirooverr' of t!?? JJarrier minus, had re ! turned 11 pi-r «>iit. int.-i-est on an aiorage for u. number of yc-inj. The Americans had de signated the great Atlantic a ""herring jjund,"" and just as it was a very good herring pond, (o was the Port Pirie Kivcr a very good ditch. Tin- House wuie years ago passed an ittnn of <:10,000 for improving tlie Port Pirie River, and this had not yet tx-cn granted, and this '• £2,.~i<jiJ was odj- a p<jrtiou of the sum. He regretted that the Treasurer had not even his way clear to place tho balance of the amount in the Luau uill. As to the Beetaloo water scheme, he would like the Trt-asurer to get his officers together, and to layduwn some defmiUj policy, mid not do the work as it had been done, by dribs and dra'os. He endorsed wliat had been said by his colleague- altout the steel main. It «-as* a hobby of the Engineer iu-Chief long before Mr. Brown re;i?orted on the Beetaloo Waterworks, and he was sorrow that a ComnuKisioncr of Public Works, who was no longer a member of the House, en dorsed the policy of the Eiigineer-in-Chief. Before involving tlie country in an experiuien tal ex-fK-nditure he thould have tried a short length of thu steel main near Adelaide. He re grett*«i that th>-y liad departed from tho cast ironnmin and sub'titiitedafrajrileime, only kept together by the asphalt v.-hicli surrounds it. (Mr. BrooSer—•' You Jin! wrong."") Of course the hon. niombsr ropresent?-d Kilkenny. He foars^d the st«l pipes would yet be an ex- P""""nsivp affair to the colony. Hu re (.T'.'tted that the Engin-i-r-in-Chifi was forced to hold k? many olSits, and to be sucli a Pooh-Bah. Our ""Water Conei-rvation Di-p-trtme-at p-quired a man at its head who thoroughly understood his work, and who had liad experience as a hydraulic engineer. 11. -gav?tiie Cor.srrvator «f Water ortviit for the tact tiia: notwitlistanding the whole amount eipundi-d in bis di^MTtmi-nt we are receiving a return of 3 per o-nt.. although hn thought that natural circumstancs had more to do with this result than the adminttration.

He wuntixl to.hav.- a few words ai,,ut .-lause S, \rfaii-li pi-.jvi.led tliat: ""The Tiva&uivr uuv raiw au.-ii portion of the luans autiiori--^.-.! by 'Th.; Public Purjwsra, Luan Act, IHI.*',' u!id * The Public Puq>ases L.jau Act, i&.tO,' as he shall tliuik proper by the ib.-iif and of U.11.U instt-^d of by the issue ajid salo of iitocrilxJ or regiatered atoi-k, and su.'h Iwutis may be iii the form luTeinbcfon provided, and such bolide diall bear iutenat at the rate of three pounds u-n shillings |xt centum per annum, to lie pai.l lialf-yearly, and tlie ]>iincijial fh*ll lju paid at a dxte of 4Ti years from the date of tale, and both principal au.l interest i-hail Ik payable in Adelaide or iu London."" Members had found fault with the clause being iu the fiirare tense, but the fact was that they could not issue l?nds that were aute-dau-d. because whenever tliey were i^aed they would have to bear a date to the jiissiug of the Act. Th.-refoie it was necessary to pra\?ide in clause S tiiat the Tmassurer might ift-ue the ixinds. The mere i^sue of the bonds would be a tiling to lip done in the future, and would relate to a transaction of which the House iiad boen fully ad vhsvd,and which look place with theSu\infs liankshdu time ugo. The £^a\in^s liunk held i;"")S2,-'>i*il on the distinct understand ing between the Treasurer and the bank that that was suld subject to the approval of Par liament, and the bonds would be Usucd as soon as the sanction of Parliament had been obtained. If tlie House chose to strike it out the Rank would have to taka inscribed stock, hut other wise the Treasurer would make out bonds for the bank to represent the money lent. Mr. Grainger hod made much of the question of whether there should be bonds or stock. If they went on tho London market they would issue .stocn which commanded a better price than bonds, but in Soi'th Australia, and especially in dealing with the Savings Bank, they would find it better to deal in bonds, as it would suit their customers' requirements best. The Government, therefore, did Dot wish to place themselves out of court and prevent the best price being obtained. The only other argu ment was that the Government might have introduced this provision in a separate Bill, but he had known a Bill for a few clauses occupy hours of discussion. Here, however, was a Bill dealing with loans, and the Government thought it was tbe proper place to introduce it. He admitted that there was force in the argument that possibly mis conception would be caused in London, but. to prevent that he was quite prepared tondd a few words to clause S to show that the issue of bonds under the Acts of 1800and 1«I3 would bo in respect to bonds sold to the Smings Bank of South Australia. With regard to the general qu«?tion iupnil>ers u-r-rc saying that the <Jo venimont were adding £40,000 a year to the taxation which was being piled up. He wisiied sonv meraljeni would in; a little more accurate in their statements. He lielicved that the people of the dlouy were laden as li?avily as they oiuld bear, and that they should lighten the burdens itf taxation, but it was not true that they had been piling it on. in I)SU taxation was at the rate of £2 12s. 6d. per head, Hi the next year £2 10s. !?d.. in the next £2 ss. (id., and last year £2 4s. 7d. (Mr. Howe— "" We could far better afford to pay the highest amount-;' and Mr. Uomburg—""But the £2 4s. 7d. inelud'-s free education."") Yes, they liad remitted (id. a wi-ek iu respect to every cliild attending the State schools. He would I?iut out how the Customs revenue liad come down. In 1891 we received £M15,000, in 181(2 £012,000, in ISO £035.000, and last year £500,000. (Mr. Grainger —"" And we have increased our dutit-s."") It was ljecause poods were now 25 per cent, cheaper. (Mr. Homburg—""More than that."") Heneedsay little further, as Ik- was prf-pared to give the f ullfst information in t-ommitt<?K. He wanted. bmnwr, to emphasise the fact that the Bill was w?rking oil what was generally termed a d<!ad horse, and it was u dead horse, the Imrd.-n of which had come to this Parliament against the protest of himself and other members, including, he thought, Mr. Grainger. In 181G they protested against Parliament authorising works and shunting the doty of paying lor them on to futun- Parliaments. It was in vain, and they now bad to lie.ir the coiiFequences. (Sir John Downer—""What*expenditure do you refer to;'') The Happy Valley wafTvrorkfi and Messrs. Martin & Co.'s contract for engines. (Mr. Homburg—""We did not want to borrow for three or four years ahead."") They should not be askixi to pass a Loan Bill to pay otlierV debts. (Mr. Homburg —- ""* You have not covered all the liabilities in your BilL You have cut £200.000 off payment for pnstural improvements."") They had gone as far as they could fcee. He asked the House to st-ttie the question once and for all, and to let the Government settle obligations which h&d been entered into by their predecessors. Although the Government had power to raise tile money yet they pledged themselves not to do so other than in the wueht and best possible way. (Mr. Gilbert—""lt is not altogether a dead horse.'"") He tiwd the words iu the sense tlu: thfy uMially uvrr, meaning that it was an obligation which thvy had not altogether in cum-d. The Govi-rnnnnt asked this Parlia in«it not to |«a.K-< on to its successors thrw- Imrden^ which it incurred, as their pn-dmss'jrs had <lno? in this case. •Sir.lolm Dowht -*' Wiiv didn't you have ?

The TREASURER, in answer to Mr. Hague, gave the following details of amounts provided for railway accommodation in Loan Acts of ISW and 1892. Under the former Act, the amount authorised for addi tional rolling-stock was £110,000, and the amount available, £37?. 140. Tbe other figures were:—Additional signalling and interlocking, £15.%73) authorised and £142.131 available; additional water supplies, £30,750 and £28,448: guard-rails at 30 feet openings, £5,400 and £5.130; funeral platform Adelaide railway station, £5,000 and £1,750: alterations Bat l.iT.r.ili station, £t,700 and i3,515; fencing line Strathalbyn to Port Victor, £7,850 and £7.458: additional bouses, £10,000 aud £0,500; rm^ning station buildings, £9,000 and £H.550; additional requirements, 110,300 and £5,4H7.

Mr. BRUOKER said the £5.000 for die funeral fiatfonu might be excised. Mr. HAGUE did not know where the discrepancy was. The s-um of £109,000 might be ttruck off the railways and transferred to tbe equipment. The TREASURER said it would be impos sible to go on with the south-eastern drainage works next year if that suggestion were adopted. Sir. BURGOYXE hoped that the Treasurer would find railway works to absorb the railway balano?-. Mr. GILES did not see why money should b* held over with the view ot its being spent on public works- Mr. McPHERSOX said the House should have more information as to unexpended balm??i. He wanted u> know bow much money was available in connection irith various lines."
